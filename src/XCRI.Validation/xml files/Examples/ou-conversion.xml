			<dc:description>Designed to follow our key introductory course in arts and humanities, The arts past and present (AA100), which you are strongly advised to study first, this 20-week course focuses on language in a wide range of contexts and from the perspective of different academic subjects. These include subjects familiar from studying The arts past and present - classical studies, history, literature, music, religious studies - and two additional subjects, creative writing and English language studies. Voices and texts will help you to prepare for your studies at Level 2 by giving you opportunities to sharpen your analytical skills and to develop new approaches to your own writing.</dc:description>

			<dc:description>How does a country without political independence gain an identity? What is the role of history and historians in shaping national memory and identity? What sources have historians used, and how should we scrutinise them? This short, 15-credit course introduces you to themes and methods used in understanding Welsh history. Using case studies ranging from the impact of Tom Jones and the Welsh rugby team in the twentieth century, to castle building under Edward I, this course will develop your understanding of Welsh history, the craft of the historian, and some of the ways in which national identities are formed. This is a 15-week online course.</dc:description>

			<dc:description>This course takes a student-centred approach to creative writing, offering a range of strategies to help you develop as a writer. The emphasis is highly practical, with exercises and activities designed to ignite and sustain the writing impulse. The five-part course starts by showing ways of using your memory and experience and building a daily discipline. This is followed by demonstration and practice of the three most popular forms - writing fiction, writing poetry, and life writing (biography and autobiography). The concluding part aims to demystify the world of agents and publishers, teaching you how to revise and present your work to a professional standard.</dc:description>

			<dc:description>This fascinating introduction to the last five centuries of medical history traces developments in medicine from the Renaissance to the early twentieth century. It shows how a heritage of medical thought and practice inherited from classical Greece gradually became a recognisably modern medicine. The course aims to set medicine in its social, political and economic contexts, looking at the patient's changing experience of illness, their access to care, and the role and identity of healers across Europe. It shows how western medicine interacted with ideas from contemporary science, religion, and other systems of thought.</dc:description>

			<dc:description>This introduction to philosophy considers fundamental questions from six core areas: the self; philosophy of religion; ethics; knowledge and science; the mind; and political philosophy. What makes me 'Me'? Does God exist? Why should I act morally? Can I trust science? How can I, a physical being, have thoughts and emotions? Should I obey laws I disagree with? Philosophers - both past and present - have offered radically diverging answers to these and the other questions asked in this course. Guided engagement with this philosophical tradition will provide the platform for you to tackle the big questions of philosophy for yourself.</dc:description>

			<dc:description>This course is an introduction to the principles of music, in which you will learn how music 'works'. At the beginning of the course, you'll examine the fundamental elements of Western music and compare them with examples drawn from other musical cultures (such as Indian). In later units you will develop a more detailed understanding of rhythm, melody, harmony, polyphony, instrumentation, structure and form. To test out and use this understanding, you will learn how to compose a song and - by the end of the course - will have written a complete song with piano accompaniment, using Sibelius music notation software.</dc:description>

			<mlo:assessment>You will be expected to submit your tutor-marked assignments (TMAs) online through the eTMA system unless there are some difficulties which prevent you from doing so. In these circumstances, you must negotiate with your tutor to get their agreement to submit your assignment on paper. The assignments will cover the following elements: learning to use Sibelius to write music notation songwriting exercises, which test your grasp of text-setting and the musical skills taught throughout the course descriptive and analytical essays on extracts of recorded and notated music.</mlo:assessment>
			<learningOutcome>By the end of the course, you will have developed fluency in the following areas: aural perception reading two- and three-stave scores in detail, and orchestral scores in less detail, identifying essential landmarks the understanding and use of common musical procedures, covering melody, rhythm, harmony, polyphony, and musical forms description and analysis of music and its styles, with the use of recordings and scores writing musical notation on up to three staves (e.g. keyboard instrument plus voice) composition on two and three staves the use of Sibelius music notation software to write music.</learningOutcome>
			<mlo:prerequisite>This is a Level 2 course and builds on the Level 1 courses The arts past and present (AA100), Voices and texts (A150) and Making sense of things: an introduction to material culture (A151). These courses develop skills such as logical thinking, clear expression, essay writing and the ability to select and interpret relevant materials. They also offer an introduction to a range of subjects in the arts and humanities. If you have not studied at University level before, you are strongly advised to study Level 1 courses before progressing to Level 2 study. Start listening to music (A179) would also provide a good introduction to the specific skills of listening and writing about music, though it does not include the reading of music notation. Your regional or national centre will be able to tell you where you can see reference copies, or you can buy selected materials from Open University Worldwide Ltd. You are expected to have some elementary knowledge of music and music notation, but you don't require any formal qualification in order to start the course. If you have played an instrument, or sung in a choir or group, you may well have the experience that you need. The level of knowledge required at the start of the course is roughly that of Grade 3 Theory of the Associated Board (ABRSM) music syllabus. This includes the following: common note-values, and equivalent rests, and their most usual rhythmic groupings time signatures pitches and their positions on the stave (treble and bass) the most common scales, keys and key signatures (major and minor, with up to four sharps and flats) common intervals and chords (triads). If you have studied The technology of music (TA212) you will already be familiar with these aspects of music theory. The early units of A224 revisit these elements, but on the assumption that you have encountered them before, and have some ability to read music notation. It is appropriate to study Inside music even if you have already studied the discontinued course Understanding music: elements techniques and styles (A214) as the content of the course is not the same.</mlo:prerequisite>

It will introduce you to the study of English literature by looking at a selection of texts from the Renaissance to the present day. The course offers a stimulating mix of classic texts and less well-known works from a range of genres, including drama, poetry and prose fiction as well as autobiography, travel-writing and film.

			<dc:description>This course combines an introduction to classical Greek language with the study of classical Greek culture and literature in translation. It is intended for beginners in Greek and assumes no previous experience of language learning. The course teaches you basic vocabulary and grammar, and sets you on your way to reading Greek texts in the original. The course uses the JACT Reading Greek series, augmented by Study Guides. Your language learning is also supported by specially designed interactive resources. Alongside your language work, you study set texts in English (Euripides' Medea , Aristophanes' Clouds and Plato's Defence of Socrates ) from literary, cultural and performance angles.</dc:description>

			<mlo:prerequisite>This is a Level 2 course and builds on the Level 1 courses The arts past and present (AA100), Voices and texts (A150) and Making sense of things:an introduction to material culture (A151). These Level 1 courses develop skills such as logical thinking, clear expression, essay writing and the ability to select and interpret relevant materials. They also offer an introduction to a range of subjects in the arts and humanities. AA100 also introduces the Greek world with a case study of Seamus Heany's The Burial at Thebes , a modern version of Sophocles' tragedy Antigone . Aspects of ancient Greek culture - the gods and heroes in Homer's Iliad -are introduced in A150. If you have not studied at university level before, you are strongly advised to study at Level 1 before progressing to Level 2 study.

We particularly recommend looking at these materials if you have not successfully completed Level 1 study or studied at an equivalent level elsewhere. Although you don't require any knowledge of the Greek language, this course does demands consistent work and commitment from the beginning. If you have experience of learning an ancient language (perhaps from Reading classical Latin (A297)) you will be aware that regular study sessions are the only way to gain and retain a reading knowledge of the language.

			<dc:description>This beginner's course in reading classical Latin introduces you to key vocabulary and the basics of Latin grammar, as you work towards tackling original texts on your own - such as passages from Roman drama and Cicero's famous speeches. The language is taught in its historical and cultural context, complementing your studies with an awareness of Roman society and literature. No previous knowledge of Latin is needed, but you're strongly advised to familiarise yourself with grammatical terms in English beforehand - a preparatory booklet is available. Reading about Roman civilisation is also a helpful and enjoyable way to gain a cultural background to the course.</dc:description>

			<dc:description>This course takes you right to the heart of twentieth-century literature - the excitement it has caused, the provocative critical debates it has generated, the political and historical influences it has developed from. Alongside close critical study of works by the century's major literary lions (Brecht, T.S. Eliot, Virginia Woolf, Chekhov and others), you will place them in the contexts in which they were written and read, examine the debates and arguments of influential critics, and analyse alternative interpretations. The course is divided into four blocks: the function of literature; different modernisms; notions of popularity; and questions of evaluation.</dc:description>

			<dc:description>Empires have had a remarkable impact on world history over the last five centuries. The six blocks of this course each focus on a particular question, from 'What are empires?' to 'Why do empires end?', considering the British Empire in detail before drawing comparisons with others, including those of France, the Netherlands, Russia, China and Spain. You'll study a wide range of primary sources, including letters and diaries, newspapers, political papers, paintings, photographs and newsreel footage. The course is a natural choice if you have already studied Exploring history: medieval to modern 1400-1900 (A200), and can be included in a range of degree programmes.</dc:description>

			<dc:description>What is myth? This Level 3 course is a broad interdisciplinary study of Greek and Roman myth in its social, historical, literary and visual context. It combines the detailed study of individual works of literature, art and architecture with an exploration of context, function and purpose. A particular aspect you will study is the reception of mythical ideas and images in later European culture. Interactive visual explorations of key ancient and modern sites, monuments and artefacts relevant to mythological themes are supplied on DVD-ROM - together with audio interviews with experts tracing the influence of myth on, for example, drama, science and medicine.</dc:description>

			<dc:description>Advanced creative writing develops your writing ability by widening your generic range and developing your knowledge of style. The course works on the forms introduced in the Level 2 course Creative writing (A215) - fiction, poetry and life writing - and supplements these with dramatic writing, showing you how to write for stage, radio and film. You'll explore how these scriptwriting skills might enhance your prose style, improve your writing across the range of forms, and further develop your individual style and voice. The course offers guidance on professional layouts for the dramatic media, and is a natural progression from Creative writing (A215).</dc:description>

			<dc:description>This intermediate course builds on your knowledge of Latin vocabulary and grammar, teaching you the skills required for reading and appreciating original texts on your own - from the works of Catullus and Ovid to Virgil's account of the fall of Troy in Aeneid II . Besides working on translation skills, you will also engage in cultural and literary study of the texts, viewing them as both great pieces of literature and rich insights into Roman culture. A natural follow on from Reading classical Latin (A297), the course also suits students with a good basic grounding in Latin.</dc:description>

			<dc:description xsi:type="xcriTerms:careerOutcome">In combination with the wide-ranging issues and concepts explored in MA English part 1 (A815), this course will provide you with an extensive theoretical and practical training in major issues in the study of literature, as well as in research methods, project planning and writing. The MA is the ideal preparation for higher-level doctoral study, and indeed an MA qualification is usually required for admission to a programme of research leading to a PhD. The training in research and writing that you acquire in the course of your MA studies will also be invaluable for any job for which a high level of research and writing skills are required, and is of specific relevance for careers such as teaching, journalism and other media work, and librarianship. The MA in English can open up a wide range of careers, from the city to the civil service, from the classroom to the newsroom.</dc:description>
			<dc:description>This course enables you to complete your MA in English by producing a 12,000-15,000 word dissertation on a topic that you choose yourself, guided by your tutor and building on the study areas and approaches you explored in MA English Part 1 (A815). This provides a satisfying culmination to your studies enabling you to demonstrate your command of scholarly techniques and your skill in devising, planning and writing an extended research project in literature. Highly rewarding in its own right, the MA dissertation is also an ideal preparation for doctoral level research and for a wide range of careers.</dc:description>

			<dc:description>The purpose of this MA course is to equip you to undertake higher-level study in art history. Within it, you'll explore six different methodological approaches in depth, from biography and iconography to feminist art history and the 'period eye'. Each methodology is addressed by set books and associated material covering a range of different subjects, from Italian Renaissance art to Indian temple sculpture. For each block, you'll also be expected to study works of art of your own choosing, applying the methods exemplified in each book, and to write an assignment - all of which will develop your analytical skills.</dc:description>

			<dc:description>Building on the philosophy postgraduate foundation course, this course explores issues with a significance that extends far beyond the boundaries of academic philosophy. You'll look at distributive justice, liberalism versus communitarianism and the metaphysics of social explanation - and go on to examine citizenship, nationalism, punishment and democracy in the light of these themes. You'll develop your ability to analyse philosophical texts; reflect on the process of philosophical research; and hone your skills in finding and using material. You'll also be required to show greater independence of thought and the ability to put across a coherent case for a philosophical position.</dc:description>

			<dc:description>The study of classical antiquity is essentially interdisciplinary. This course enables you to explore the Greco-Roman world in the context of four broadly-based topics: social history; ideas and values; literature; and archaeology. You'll study these topics through textual and visual primary sources and a selection of modern scholarship in articles and set books. The work will help you to develop basic research skills and techniques of independent study at postgraduate level, and introduce you to the use of IT. You'll also have the opportunity to design and carry out a short research proposal on a topic that particularly interests you.</dc:description>

You'll relate textual study to staging, compare ancient and modern performance, explore the contemporary socio-political context for drama and take a look at concepts and methods used in studies of the later translation and reception of the plays. You'll also explore critical approaches to topics such as audience, chorus, gender, humour and theatrical language. You'll need access to a good library and the internet.</dc:description>

			<mlo:prerequisite>To take this course, you must be registered for the MA in Humanities or for another qualification towards which it can count. If you have not taken the classical studies postgraduate foundation course you may need to refer to it in the early stages of A861, especially its Skills section and Library Guide . A861 assumes that you are familiar with the basic investigation and research techniques and the critical use of modern scholarship introduced in the classical studies foundation course, and that you can use them with increasing independence of judgement. Knowledge of the Greek or Latin language is not necessary, though some would be useful. You should, though, try to be familiar with the Greek alphabet and to recognise key terms, concepts and ideas in transliterated form. Elementary Greek (or Latin) could be valuable for later work, especially for the dissertation course (depending on your topic). We offer introductory Greek and Latin courses at undergraduate level: Reading classical Greek: language and literature (A275) and Reading classical Latin (A297). If you have any doubt about the suitability of the course, please contact our Student Registration &amp; Enquiry Service.</mlo:prerequisite>

			<dc:description>How does music research inform the study of musical performance? This course offers an extensive introduction to the research methods associated with performances (recordings); musical texts; written documents; instruments/voices; and ethnographies. You'll have the opportunity to study music from many periods and styles, including popular and non-Western music as well as Western art music. You'll be guided on the use of libraries and other research tools that will enable you to undertake work at postgraduate level. In particular, you'll be encouraged to make extensive use of the OU online library and bibliographic facilities, including the complete New Grove Online.</dc:description>

			<dc:description>This course, which is part of the MA in Music and the MA in Humanities, builds on the postgraduate foundation course in music. You'll study musical performances in relation to the environments and institutions in which composers worked, making use of research facilities such as extensive online libraries and archives. You'll also have plenty of scope to study recordings. Music from the Western art tradition is represented alongside music of non-Western and popular traditions, and you'll have ample opportunity to pursue your own enthusiasms within the course themes. At the end, you'll be expected to initiate, plan and write a 5000 word project.</dc:description>

			<dc:description>This broadly-focused course introduces you to university-level study in the arts across a range of subject areas - art history, classical studies, English, history, history of science, philosophy, music and religious studies. It is structured around four themes, in order to guide you through some of the basic concerns of arts subjects: Reputations; Tradition and Dissent; Cultural Encounters; and Place and Leisure. Your studies will range from poetry to string quartets, and from sculpture to short stories - across a wide variety of cultures and historical periods. This key introductory Level 1 course is also a useful means of acquiring the key skills required for further study of arts and humanities subjects.</dc:description>

			<mlo:prerequisite>This is a key introductory Level 1 course. Level 1 courses provide core subject knowledge and study skills needed for both higher education and distance learning, to help you progress to courses at Level 2. As this course is a broad introduction to the study of the arts and humanities and to the University as a whole, no assumptions are made about the knowledge or education you bring to it. Successful completion of this course will equip you to go on to Voices and texts (A150), Making sense of things: an introduction to material culture (A151) or any of the more specialised Level 2 arts courses. By the end of AA100 you will be expected to be working successfully at the level required of first-year undergraduate students. If you are new or a less confident learner, start with Making sense of the arts (Y180). This is an Openings course, also at Level 1 but worth 15 credits. Designed with lots of support and no examination, it will give you a gentle introduction to this subject and to OU study. If you successfully complete this Openings course, you'll be ready to study AA100. If you have any doubt about the suitability of the course, please contact our Student Registration &amp; Enquiry Service.</mlo:prerequisite>

			<dc:description>This theme-based course draws on a wide variety of musical traditions and periods, including western art music of the last 500 years, jazz, popular and film music, and music of non-western traditions. You'll examine the processes by which music is formed and transmitted - composition, improvisation, performance, editing, and publication - and social and historical factors that shape those processes. You need appropriate knowledge of harmony, form and score-reading before you start the course; these will enable you to develop technical skills in tasks such as transcribing and editing music. The assessed essays require evaluation of historical and contemporary sources, listening to music and engaging with musical controversies and debates.</dc:description>

			<mlo:prerequisite>AA302 is a Level 3 course. Level 3 courses build on study skills and subject knowledge acquired from previous studies at Levels 1 and 2. They are intended only for students with recent experience of higher education in a related subject, preferably at the OU. The reading and writing skills developed in The arts past and present (AA100) and From Enlightenment to Romanticism c.1780-1830 (A207) would be ideal preparation for this course. This course requires a knowledge of harmony, form and score reading at the level of our Level 2 music courses. You are strongly advised to study Inside music (A224), before taking AA302, unless you have already studied the discontinued course A214. Your regional or national centre will be able to tell you where you can see reference copies of the Level 1 and 2 study materials, or you can buy selected materials from Open University Worldwide Ltd. If you have any doubt about the suitability of the course, please contact our Student Registration &amp; Enquiry Service.</mlo:prerequisite>

			<dc:description>This intensive study of ten Shakespeare plays and the Sonnets takes close account of the social and political circumstances in which they were written and performed. This broad historicist approach is complemented by a strong emphasis on the diversity of twentieth-century critical responses to the plays and on modern productions of them, both on stage and on screen. The course will develop your knowledge of the range and variety of Shakespeare's dramatic and poetic work; examine how its reception and status has been shaped by cultural and institutional factors; and explore themes such as questions of genre, politics, sexuality and gender.</dc:description>

			<dc:description>This course expands interests in religious studies and/or history. Why has religion led to conflict? Does conversion matter? When is peaceful coexistence possible? In exploring these and other questions you will move in time from the Roman Empire to September 11, 2001, and in space between Britain, Europe, India, the Middle East, Africa and the United States. Case studies include the Crusades, the Reformation, and the Holocaust. You will engage with controversies regarding the impact of Europe on the non-Western world, and over the 'death of Christian Britain'. Through extending your knowledge of history you will better understand contemporary problems.</dc:description>

			<dc:description>On this course, you will explore a number of central philosophical questions concerning the nature and activities of the human mind, and its place in the natural and social worlds. You will encounter the opinions of great thinkers from history as well as of contemporary philosophers, and examine related issues in aesthetics, the theory of knowledge, metaphysics and the philosophy of language. You will examine the development of conceptions of the mind and explore four topics in detail: emotion; thought and language; imagination and creativity; and consciousness.</dc:description>

			<dc:description>This is not simply another course on Renaissance art. It questions the traditional geographical and social boundaries of this subject - one of the most traditional in the art history discipline - in line with contemporary developments in academic research. Instead of focusing on the Italian peninsula and Florence in particular (as has been the tendency for most histories of Renaissance art c .1420-1520), this course ventures to England, the Netherlands, France, Italy and Crete. It includes art forms such as prints, tapestries, manuscripts, painting, sculpture and architecture, centred around three main themes: Making Renaissance Art; Locating Renaissance Art; and Viewing Renaissance Art .</dc:description>

			<mlo:assessment>You will be expected to submit your tutor-marked assignments (TMAs) online through the eTMA system unless there are some difficulties which prevent you from doing so. In these circumstances, you must negotiate with your tutor to get their agreement to submit your assignment on paper. The end-of-module assessment (EMA) is a project that must be submitted on paper. You will be assessed on all three course book topics by means of a multi-part tutor-marked assignment (TMA). Each TMA is double weighted, i.e. the equivalent of two conventional TMAs. In addition to these three TMAs, you will be required to submit a project proposal, and an end-of-module assessment project that will be the examinable component. For the end-of-module assessment project (the independent essay), you'll need to have first hand access to at least one work of art of your own choice that is central or closely relevant to your independent essay subject. This work need not be in an art gallery; it could be in a stately home, a church or cathedral, or a building in your local area.</mlo:assessment>
			<learningOutcome>You will learn about the art-historical period traditionally known as the Renaissance ( c .1420- c .1520) and develop a systematic and critical knowledge and understanding of some key aspects of Renaissance art within and beyond the confines of Italy. You will obtain an awareness of current thinking and developments in relation to some key issues of the study of Renaissance art. In line with contemporary art-historical study, you will also broaden your knowledge of the discipline to include media not traditionally classed as fine art: illuminated manuscripts, tapestries and prints. The project (independent essay) that completes the course will enable you to reassess the period through an in-depth study of a self-chosen topic relating to the themes of the course. You do not need to have a topic in mind before you start the course. You will receive help and advice on choosing a topic at various stages of the course. Through the use of video and ICT you will learn how to analyse and interpret works of art (architecture, sculpture, painting, etc.) in their immediate physical context. You will also explore complex works of three-dimensional art (architecture, sculpture, cities) that cannot be properly represented within the limits of a few illustrations.</learningOutcome>
			<mlo:prerequisite>This is a Level 3 course and as such it builds on study skills and subject knowledge acquired from previous studies at Levels 1 and 2. Level 3 courses are intended only for students who have recent experience of higher education in a related subject and have already acquired the skills appropriate for this level, such as analytical thinking and essay writing. You are not expected to have any particular knowledge of Renaissance art, but some experience of studying art history at undergraduate level would be very advantageous. If you have no such experience we advise you to study a Level 2 art history course, Exploring art and visual culture (A226), before embarking on this Level 3 course.

			<dc:description>Novels in the nineteenth century were particularly engaged with the events, circumstances, beliefs and attitudes of their time. This course encourages you to enjoy and understand them through the study of twelve texts from England (mainly), France and the USA, including works by Jane Austen, Charlotte Bronte, Dickens, George Eliot, Flaubert and Conrad. The focus is on understanding the role of the novel in representing and exploring social and cultural change, the flexibility of the genre and how it developed aesthetically, stylistically and structurally. You'll also engage with academic debates appropriate to study at Level 3, through the examination of contemporary and current critical approaches.</dc:description>

			<dc:description>Fundamental changes took place in the concepts and practices of art during the twentieth century. This course introduces you to different types of art - ranging from traditional media such as painting and sculpture to video art, photography, installation and performance art - and to a variety of critical and theoretical interpretations. Central topics include the relation of the modernist mainstream to new 'postmodernist' standpoints; the status of the art object; the role of gender and identity; and the place of a predominantly European tradition in an increasingly globalised culture. The course discusses artists from Picasso to Warhol, and movements from Surrealism to Conceptual Art.</dc:description>

			<dc:description>What is the nature and value of heritage? Why are certain objects, places and practices considered more worthy of protection than others? This course will introduce you to the study of heritage and its function at local, regional, national and global levels. You'll develop a critical understanding of how heritage is created and consumed across different cultures, and the roles heritage fulfils in contemporary and past societies. Using case material from around the world you'll explore the global scope of heritage, from the ways in which local communities use heritage to build their own sense of identity, to the ways in which the state employs heritage in nation building.</dc:description>

			<mlo:prerequisite>This is a Level 2 course and builds on the Level 1 courses The arts past and present (AA100), Voices and texts (A150) and Making sense of things: an introduction to material culture (A151). These Level 1 courses develop skills such as logical thinking, clear expression, essay writing and the ability to select and interpret relevant materials. They also offer an introduction to the range of subjects in the arts and humanities. If you have not studied at university level before, we strongly advise you to study at Level 1 before progressing to Level 2 study. Any of the Level 2 arts and humanities courses, in particular Exploring history: medieval to modern 1400-1900 (A200), and World archaeology (A251), would make a good pairing with this course. Similarly, you might consider pairing this course with other courses in social sciences or environment, development and international studies. Your regional or national centre can advise you on where you can see reference copies of Level 1 study materials. We particularly recommend looking at these materials if you have not successfully completed Level 1 study or studied at an equivalent level elsewhere. If you have any doubt about the suitability of the course, please contact our Student Registration &amp; Enquiry Service.</mlo:prerequisite>

			<dc:description>Religion is a powerful force in today's world, as almost any newspaper or news broadcast will make clear. Inextricably linked with nationalism, popular culture, social norms and the lives of individuals, it touches almost every area of public and private life. This course will be of interest to those who are curious about the role of religion today and who wonder whether secularisation means the eventual death of religious practices and institutions. It studies examples of religious ideas, practices and teachings from around the world, and sets religion in the wider context of the societies in which it is embedded.</dc:description>

			<mlo:prerequisite>The course will prepare you for work on philosophy courses at Level 3. It should appeal to you if you are taking, or have taken, Philosophy and the human situation (A211), and is also a good choice if you are taking, or have taken, a Level 3 course in philosophy and want to brush up your skills. You are strongly advised not to attempt this course if you have not previously done some formal study of philosophy at A-level or undergraduate level (as part of The arts past and present (AA100) for example). If you have any doubt about the level of study please seek advice from our Student Registration &amp; Enquiry Service. Whilst students are unable to take the course a second time for credit, they may choose to take the course again as a voluntary attendee if places are available. Voluntary attendees receive the same tuition at the school as regular attendees, but are not required to submit the EMA once the course is over. Every year about ten students choose to study another strand of the course without receiving credit. If you have already received credit for the course and are interested in attending the residential school again please contact us .</mlo:prerequisite>

			<dc:description>Studying law is stimulating in its own right, and it's also a smart career move. If you want to practise law professionally, a law degree is a first and necessary step - but it's also a great asset for many other careers that are not directly related to law. The Open University's LLB is the most popular undergraduate taught law degree programme in the UK. We offer it in collaboration with the College of Law - the UK's largest provider of professional legal education. The compulsory modules of this degree course cover the seven 'Foundations of Legal Knowledge' - the academic subjects required for a Qualifying Law Degree (QLD). These are set by The Solicitors Regulation Authority and The Bar Standards Board (the professional legal bodies). By the end of your studies, you'll have the legal awareness needed to understand and apply the law, together with skills of legal analysis and methods.</dc:description>

			<abstract>Highly regarded, this degree will enable you to pursue a career in the legal professions or improve your legal understanding in your curren</abstract>
			<learningOutcome>Jobs directly related to law include solicitor, barrister, legal executive and paralegal. Solicitors and barristers usually work in private practice, in central or local government, commerce, industry, the armed forces or in professional bodies. Solicitors and barristers in England and Wales need to complete three stages of training: Academic - a Qualifying Law Degree (QLD) Vocational - a Legal Practice Course (LPC). If you successfully complete our QLD, the College of Law will guarantee you a place on its LPC, You need to take up this place within seven years of graduation Professional - a training contract for solicitors or 'pupillage' for barristers. You can download our Recognition leaflet 3.13 Law for more information about the legal professions and details of professional recognition outside of England and Wales. The Bachelor of Laws (Honours) (LLB) can also open up many career options that are not just in the legal profession. Roles in finance, human resources, local government or general management all benefit from a legal background and from the discipline of studying a degree course. Employers recognise that studying law gives you the chance to develop yourself beyond the boundaries of your normal work environment, giving you skills and knowledge that you can readily put into practice on a daily basis in your job. There is more information about how OU study can improve your employability in the OU's Employability Statement from our Careers Advisory Service.

			<dc:description>Psychology pervades just about every aspect of our personal and professional lives. The frequent query, 'What do you have in mind?' quite literally captures much of what psychology - the science of human behaviour - is all about. Studying our BSc (Honours) Psychology degree course (accredited by the British Psychological Society) gives you a window into the workings of the mind - why we do the things we do and how we interact with others. On this fascinating journey you'll gain knowledge and understanding of the different areas of psychology; develop valuable analytical and communication skills; and enhance your ability to work both independently and collaboratively, all of which will put you very much in the frame when it comes to employment opportunities. You'll also explore how psychologists use evidence derived from research to contribute to debates on matters such as ageing, crime, education, employment, forensic science, mental health, relationships and much more.</dc:description>

			<dc:description>Our world is divided into many different societies. Yet it is increasingly interconnected. Relationships between nations, companies, cultures and individuals extend across regions and the globe. The BA/BSc (Honours) International Studies enables you to explore the political, economic and cultural issues that these complex interconnections create. The core concerns of this degree course range from international politics, diplomacy, cooperation, war and security to international economics and development; from cultural and religious interactions between different societies to global environmental problems. Although International Studies at the OU has a particular emphasis on development and the issues and problems facing developing countries, this degree is also concerned with the overall political make-up of the international system and the sources of order and disorder within it. Throughout your studies, you'll have specialist, subject-based academic support and the chance to join in online communities of other social sciences students for teaching, learning and peer support.</dc:description>

			<mlo:prerequisite>This is a key introductory Level 1 course. Level 1 courses provide core subject knowledge and study skills needed for both higher education and distance learning, to help you progress to courses at Level 2. It is for anyone with an interest in business. You do not require any work or management experience, previous educational qualifications or technical knowledge, but you will be expected to participate in some online work.

			<dc:description>What makes young people tick? What shapes and influences children's development? How can the adults who work with children support them more effectively? Childhood and youth studies is one of the UK's fastest growing academic disciplines. The OU was a pioneer in this field and over the last 15 years has developed an engaging, wide-ranging, interdisciplinary programme for anyone working with children and young people or with a general interest in the field. You'll learn about child development and psychology, international childhoods, research with children, and children's literature - spanning the entire age range from early years to youth. There are three study pathways and a wide choice of module options, enabling you to follow your interests and draw on your own expertise. Whichever route you select, the BA (Honours) Childhood and Youth Studies will develop your knowledge and analytical skills in relation to policies, practices and issues affecting the lives of children and young people across a range of settings.</dc:description>

			<learningOutcome>A degree in childhood and youth studies gives you skills and knowledge relevant to many careers in childcare, health, education, working with families, playwork, or working with young people. It will develop your understanding of practices and policies that affect children, and introduce you to many new aspects of the subject - helping you make informed choices about future career paths. This degree is not a professional qualification, so many of our graduates choose to undertake postgraduate training before progressing to employment in specialist fields. This degree course emphasises independent thinking, develops analytical and communication skills and will help you become a clear and confident writer - all attributes that are highly valued by employers. It also develops your awareness of the diversity of modern childhoods. The many module options allow you to expand your expertise and interests, and managing the range of subjects will demonstrate your versatility. This degree will develop your research skills if you want to go on to further study. There is more information about how OU study can improve your employability in the OU's Employability Statement from our Careers Advisory Service. You can also read or download our publication OU study and your career and look at our subject pages to find out about career opportunities.</learningOutcome>

			<dc:description>Learning languages opens doors to other cultures and gives you an experience of the world that goes deeper than the average tourist trip. It can also provide a key to the global workplace. The BA (Honours) Modern Language Studies, delivered through a mix of online and face-to-face tuition, gives you a choice of two modern languages (from French, German and Spanish) or one modern language and English. You can also learn Italian to intermediate level, and beginners' Chinese and Welsh. On completing this degree course, you'll be a fluent communicator in at least one modern language and you'll understand how language is structured, and how its use varies in different contexts. You'll also acquire valuable transferable skills in managing and motivating yourself, setting and achieving goals, working with others and using ICT.</dc:description>

			<dc:description xsi:type="xcriTerms:careerOutcome">The focus throughout the course on developing skills (cognitive, practical and professional) closely reflects the Quality Assurance Agency's benchmark statement expectations for business studies and clearly expresses the course's intention to enhance the employability of its students. Although it has a significant theoretical component, the course's emphasis on practical application of strategic models also supports employability across a range of sectors.</dc:description>
			<dc:description>The fascinating world of strategy - from its origins and development as a subject to the controversies that dominate contemporary strategic debate - is introduced in this course. It's relevant to anyone interested in how organisations and individuals make sense of the world and strive for success. You'll develop skills in clear thinking, independent enquiry and collaborative working as you analyse and apply the ideas and approaches that have done most to influence how strategy is conceived and carried out in today's organisations, whether commercial or not-for-profit, locally, nationally and internationally. You'll take part in an online collaboration with other students for a month during the summer.</dc:description>

In these circumstances, you must negotiate with your tutor to get their agreement to submit your assignment on paper. There is also an assessed online collaborative activity - centred on a major case study - that takes place between mid June and early July.</mlo:assessment>
			<learningOutcome>Critical thinking skills: the course encourages you to adopt a critical perspective from the outset - not only supporting your detailed familiarisation with a range of theories and models, but also requiring you to take account of the circumstances and contexts in which these theories and models have been developed and applied. This is by no means a negative exercise in being wise after the event about ideas that have had their day; instead, the thorough grounding that the course offers will equip you with the skills to evaluate and select from a diverse body of knowledge guided by its appropriateness to the situation in question. This is a very important benefit from the point of view of how the course will enhance your employability. The challenges of contemporary management in whatever field necessitate precisely this kind of critically informed decision-making, rather than a sole reliance on established modes of thought. Professional and key skills : In common with the other courses in the Business Studies programme, the course uses The Open University's Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) with a particular focus on facilitating collaborative learning. Employers consistently give high priority to the skill of team-working when asked what they look for in graduates, and the course aims to give you ample opportunity to develop and demonstrate this vital professional accomplishment both face-to-face and online. Four of the six tutor-marked assignments (TMAs) include important elements that require you to work with one or more colleagues, culminating in an extended group project in the second half of the course where you will carry out joint analysis of a major case study. This mode of study has the additional benefit of helping to address the potential isolation of being a distance learner, and allows you to learn with and from like-minded students supported by an expert tutor. The assignments will develop and demonstrate your skills in analysis, problem-solving, decision-making and information literacy. Knowledge and Understanding of Strategy: There are six blocks in the course, covering a total of thirty-two weeks' study time: Block 1: Introducing Strategy starts by examining some common definitions of strategy and teasing out their assumptions and implications. After an overview of the course content and structure, supported by appropriate activities, you will be introduced to the fundamental skill of critical thinking and invited to see strategy as a social process that includes you both as learner and practitioner. Block 2: The Historical Context embarks on a journey through the development of modern strategic thought. Along the way it offers some suggestions as to why one particular approach to strategy, based on economic rationality, has become so widely accepted and persistent. At the same time it will open up questions about the efficacy and continuing relevance of this approach, and outline some of the most influential criticisms which have been made of it. Block 3: The Strategy Toolkit deals in detail with a battery of models and concepts espoused by strategists working broadly within the economic rational tradition. It examines the ways in which organisations make sense of their external and internal environments, and discusses the strengths and limitations of each technique. Stakeholder management will also feature, leading to a consideration of the wider context (ethical, political and international) in which strategy takes place. An exploration of strategic decision-making follows, relating the ways in which organisations make sense of their environments to how they select strategy to further their competitive and corporate aims. Block 4: Collaborative Analysis will extend your own analytical and decision-making skills, as you work with other students online on a case-based task. (It centres on a major case study, and you will require regular access to the internet from 9 June to 6 July 2012, a fact you may want to consider when making holiday or travel plans .) The block is activity-based and develops a combination of skills that are highly relevant to employability - team-working, information literacy and problem-solving. It presents an opportunity to relate theory to practice in a way that will increase your grasp of the debates around strategy and develop your confidence to engage in them. In addition, material developed in Block 4 contributes towards your mark for TMA 05. Block 5: Strategy Implementation seeks to demystify what in many respects is the least well-understood aspect of strategy - putting plans into practice. Key influences on implementation are examined, including the enabling (or blocking) role of culture, and how leadership affects the enactment of strategy. This block will also take account of a major focus of contemporary research, 'strategy as practice' - the close analysis of what people do - in order to examine precisely how strategy 'happens' in organisations. Block 6: Where Next for Strategy? - a s a dynamic field, strategy needs to be able to address the challenges of an increasingly unpredictable world. Complementing the historical perspective with which the course began, this final block looks at some of the directions in which contemporary strategic thinking is bound, including complexity theory, which seeks to understand how organisations can co-evolve harmoniously and successfully with their continually changing environments.</learningOutcome>
			<mlo:prerequisite>This is a Level 3 course. Level 3 courses build on study skills and subject knowledge acquired from studies at Levels 1 and 2. They are intended only for students who have recent experience of higher education in a related subject, preferably at the OU. The course is aimed at those who want a general overview of how modern organisations approach and carry out strategy. Although there are no formal entry requirements, it would be beneficial to first study Business organisations and their environments (B201) and Business functions in context (B203) because these courses introduce issues and themes that are developed in this course. Having said that, the course contains in-context study skills support designed to help you get the most out of the activities, assignments and study materials supplied. If you have any doubt about the suitability of the course, please contact our Student Registration &amp; Enquiry Service.</mlo:prerequisite>

			<dc:description>This course is about collaboration - working, managing and organising across organisational and cultural boundaries. Whether within or across organisations, via partnerships, joint ventures and alliances, collaboration can be both stimulating and rewarding. It entails the combination of resources and expertise which enables partners to achieve something jointly that they cannot achieve working alone. However, collaboration is also fraught with difficulties and dilemmas. In this course you'll explore the many issues and challenges associated with working collaboratively across different contexts. You will also learn about concepts and theories that can help you to better manage collaborative situations in the future.</dc:description>

			<dc:description>Philosophy and psychology seek to answer profound questions about us, our minds, our behaviour, and our place in the social and physical universe. What makes us happy? Do humans display irrational biases? How can I, a mere physical being, have thoughts and emotions? How does science progress and can I trust it? By what moral authority does the state rule over me? Who should get what? Is there a god? By studying this degree course in philosophy and psychological studies you'll learn to: read and understand scientific and historical texts; construct and analyse arguments; understand and use a range of research methods; and express your ideas clearly and logically. These skills are relevant to a broad range of career opportunities, including media, marketing, financial and social services, administration and management. Note: completion of this degree course will not make you eligible for the Graduate Basis for Chartered Membership (GBC) conferred by the British Psychological Society.</dc:description>

			<dc:description>What is the relationship between crime and issues of social inequality and social exclusion? If anti-social behaviour is associated with family and community breakdown, problems of mental health and substance abuse, how can these problems be dealt with more effectively? What is the evidence that early interventions in families and schools, and in communities, can achieve better outcomes? This degree takes your study of some of the key questions in contemporary criminology and social policy to an advanced level. You will examine in depth current controversies about crime and disorder in the context of the recession and cutbacks in social care, education and youth justice budgets. Local and global concerns are linked through a comparative approach to developments in different communities and countries. This wide-ranging approach will equip you with the concepts and the theories underlying contemporary social policy and criminology, together with the skills required both to evaluate the range of policy alternatives and to participate in implementing such initiatives.</dc:description>

			<learningOutcome>This degree course is relevant if you already work, or would like to work, with computing and IT systems and are looking for a qualification that gives you a sound grasp of the principles of hardware-based, software-based, or systems-based technologies - along with an ability to apply your knowledge and skills in a broad range of industries and organisations. Depending on your choice of modules, you'll gain a good preparation for employment in software engineering, communications, networks or web technologies. Designing, developing and deploying IT systems are not solitary activities: they require outstanding teamwork and 'people management' skills, along with knowledge of how businesses and organisations operate. The BSc (Honours) Computing and IT will give you the opportunity to gain experience of working in a team to tackle an appropriate development task. You'll also undertake a project to demonstrate your ability to undertake a substantial piece of work on a topic you've selected. You'll gain a range of highly valued transferable skills in: communication time management numeracy analysing and solving problems. Depending on which modules you choose, the degree may help you obtain professional recognition from the British Computing Society (BCS) - which is the Chartered Institute for IT, a professional body established by royal charter. We will be seeking professional recognition for three pathways through this degree: software development, digital technologies and a path combining both of these. There is more information about how OU study can improve your employability in the OU's Employability Statement from our Careers Advisory Service. You can also read or download our publication OU study and your career and look at our subject pages to find out about career opportunities.</learningOutcome>

			<dc:description xsi:type="xcriTerms:careerOutcome">This course is relevant for students with or without a vocational interest. The emphasis on education will make the course of particular relevance to educational practitioners. However, interwoven throughout the course are the experiences and perspectives of the full range of practitioners working with children and young people.</dc:description>
			<dc:description>This course is for anyone interested in issues of access for children and young people in diverse social and educational contexts. It supports you in engaging with differing perspectives on equality, participation and inclusion, and in developing your own perspectives. You will address the dimensions of disability, disaffection and learning difficulty in the context of wider diversity across the breadth of childhood and youth services. It asks what constitutes good participatory and inclusive practice. A range of video case studies from early years to late teens, with an emphasis on education and learning, illustrate the key themes and issues.</dc:description>

			<dc:description xsi:type="xcriTerms:careerOutcome">This course is a compulsory module in our Foundation Degree and Diploma of Higher Education in Working with Young People and in our BA (Hons) Youth Work. This course is for you if you are a practitioner currently working with young people to support their informal learning. The course defines 'work with young people' as professional interventions where participation is voluntary and the aims are to do with informal education. Such work can be within a voluntary or a statutory setting, but students must be attached to a suitable organisation (see Entry below). For example, you might be involved in: running a youth club or centre outreach or detached work with young people working in a community-based group that works with young people on social and personal development advising young people on health or careers supporting the informal learning of young people be that outside or within a formal education setting such as a school or college working with a group of Scouts or Guides.</dc:description>
			<dc:description>This course develops the practical and analytical skills needed to lead and manage work with young people. It draws on the knowledge developed in Leading work with young people (E132) and the practice developed in Introduction to working with young people in practice (E118). You must meet the minimum requirement of five hours face-to-face contact with young people per week in an appropriate setting; undertake work in an additional work-based learning setting; and obtain your organisation's permission to do work-based learning.</dc:description>

			<mlo:assessment>You must submit your tutor-marked assignments (TMAs) on paper. It is also a requirement that you attend either a face-to-face day school or take part in the online alternative learning experience instead. You will not be able to pass the course without satisfying this requirement. As part of your assignments, you will also be required to identify evidence from your practice to back up your reflections on your practice. You will be shown how to use evidence effectively and efficiently, avoiding excessive evidence gathering.</mlo:assessment>
			<learningOutcome>You'll use examples from your own practical work with leading and managing work with young people, plan and undertake a project and undertake an additional work-based learning experience in another setting from your regular work-place setting. You'll be encouraged to become a more critical reflective practitioner. You'll also learn how to compare and contrast different practices of leading work with young people and present evidence of your professional competence for assessment. You'll develop your online communication skills to support your own learning.</learningOutcome>
			<mlo:prerequisite>Before starting this course you are strongly advised to study these courses in the following order: Introduction to working with young people (E131) (or the supported APEL version EZL131) Introduction to working with young people in practice (E118) Leading work with young people (E132) (or the supported APEL version EZL132). The study materials from this course refer back to aspects of the study materials from Leading work with young people (E132) . As this is a course leading to a professional validation, you need to meet the requirements set out by the National Youth Agency and equivalent bodies in Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. These requirements state that you need to be in direct practice with young people for a total of 270 hours (paid or unpaid) over the foundation degree and for a total of 444 hours if you go on to complete the honours degree. You will have completed 135 of these hours at Level 1 and you need to complete a further 135 hours on this course at Level 2. This means working at least 5 hours a week in direct work with young people and an additional 3 hours per week planning and evaluating your work with young people. Additionally, for the professional qualification, you will need to demonstrate that you have practised in two workplaces, with at least 90 hours at Level 2 being in the second setting. These 90 hours will be counted as part of your Level 2 total of 135. You can meet this requirement in a range of ways - either by moving work setting completely, by working in two settings simultaneously or by moving for a short period to an alternative setting. If you do not have the same contact time with young people each week, this figure can be treated as an average. However, the contact must be on a regular rather than a sporadic basis i.e. 135 hours over the duration of the course, but a minimum of 17 hours each month. You will also need to: be working within an organisation in a suitable setting have support from your employer for your participation in the course (see 'Support from your workplace' below) have successfully passed through recruitment and induction processes within your organisation have successfully completed all appropriate vetting procedures for the country in which you are working (e.g. Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) check in England). It is the responsibility of you and your employer to ensure you meet these requirements, and not that of the OU. You should contact the relevant agency that deals with criminal records disclosure in your country for more information if you are in doubt about your eligibility, or to find out more have access to, or be able to obtain access to, the types of work required by the course. This work must enable you to develop leadership and management skills, undertake a new and innovative piece of work, develop a project and work in an alternative setting from your regular practice for each of your regular work and alternative work-based learning experience you must secure a person, or persons to take on the roles of: confirming that your evidence is authentic; observing your practice on one occasion; and providing supportive professional supervision. Your observer/supervisor should be professionally qualified (Joint Negotiating Committee (JNC) or equivalent) and have at least two years' post-qualifying experience. Further details of the requirements for studying E218 are contained in the Work-based Learning (WBL) Handbook available in electronic format on the WWYP website for existing students, or alternatively from the Qualification team on (01908) 653275. You will receive a printed copy of the WBL Handbook in the first mailing of study materials. If you are unsure whether your current practical work with young people meets the requirements, then please contact our Student Registration &amp; Enquiry Service.</mlo:prerequisite>

			<learningOutcome>Mathematics is at the heart of advances in science, engineering and technology, as well as being an indispensable problem-solving and decision-making tool in many other areas of life. It is no surprise therefore that mathematics postgraduates can be found throughout industry, business and commerce, in the public and private sectors. Employers value the intellectual rigour and reasoning skills that mathematics students can acquire, their familiarity with numerical and symbolic thinking and the analytic approach to problem-solving which is their hallmark. There are a variety of reasons for studying mathematics at postgraduate level. You may want a postgraduate qualification in order to distinguish yourself from an increasingly large graduate population. You may find, particularly if you are a professional programmer or work in finance, that your undergraduate mathematical knowledge is becoming insufficient for your career requirements, especially if you are hoping to specialise in one of the more mathematical areas, which are becoming more sought after by employers. The extent of opportunities is vast and mathematics postgraduates are equipped with skills and knowledge required for jobs in fields such as finance, education, engineering, science and business, as well as mathematics and mathematical science research. There is more information about how OU study can improve your employability in the OU's Employability Statement from our Careers Advisory Service.

			<mlo:prerequisite>This course is available in the UK and to students working in British Forces schools overseas and in early years settings in Europe and beyond where a curriculum similar to those found in UK settings is offered. It is expected that you will have been working with young children - either in a paid or a voluntary capacity - in an early years setting prior to starting the course for six months if full time, and a year if part time. During the course, you will need to be working in the setting for a minimum of five hours a week in order to carry out the practical activities. To work in an early years setting you will need to meet the 'fit person' criteria for doing so, including obtaining the necessary clearance required for the setting and country in which you are working. It is the responsibility of you and your employer to ensure you meet these requirements, and not the OU. You should contact the relevant agency in your country for more information if you are in any doubt about your eligibility, or to find out more. For who to contact in England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales visit the Childhood &amp; Youth website . Although it may be studied independently of other courses, E230 is a module of the Open University Foundation Degree in Early Years (FDEY), Diploma of Higher Education in Early Years (DipHE) and the BA and BA (Hons) Early Years. Students wishing to complete either degree are advised to complete the Level 1 modules (The early years: developing practice (E100) and Professional practice in the early years (E105)) before progressing to this Level 2 module. If you opt to take E230 as part of the FDEY or the DipHE you must have studied the discontinued course Inclusive education: learning from each other (E243) too, unless you have already completed E242. This is a Level 2 course. Level 2 courses provide subject knowledge and study skills needed for both higher education and distance learning to help you to progress to courses at Level 3.

			<dc:description xsi:type="xcriTerms:careerOutcome">This course is a compulsory module in our BA (Hons) Youth Work. This honours degree has received professional recognition and provides you with a valuable professional qualification to enhance your career. It is recognised as a professional qualification in England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. This course is for you if you are a practitioner currently working with young people to support their informal learning. It is mapped to the National Occupation Standards for Youth Work and will prepare you for professional practice as a youth worker, in a range of roles and settings. You will need to be working with young people aged 13-19 in a suitable organisation (see Entry below). For example, you might be involved in: running a youth club or centre outreach or detached youth work with young people working in a community-based group that works with young people on social and personal development advising young people on health or careers supporting the informal learning of young people either outside or within a formal education setting such as a school or college working with young people in Guiding or Scouts or in another voluntary organisation.</dc:description>
			<dc:description>This online course continues the development of the critical, practical and analytical skills you need to work as a professionally qualified youth worker. It is the third and final work-based learning module in the BA (Hons) Youth Work, and it builds on the knowledge, skills and practice developed in earlier work-based learning modules. You must complete a minimum of 176 hours of direct practice with young people over the duration of the module - approximately six hours of face-to-face practice a week. You will also need your organisation's permission to do work-based learning to study this course.</dc:description>

			<abstract>This online course continues the development of the critical, practical and analytical skills you need to work proactively within the youth</abstract>
			<mlo:assessment>You can choose whether to submit your tutor-marked assignments (TMAs) on paper or online through the eTMA system. You may want to use the eTMA system for some of your assignments but submit on paper for others. This is entirely your choice.</mlo:assessment>
			<learningOutcome>You'll use examples from your own practical work with young people; gather evidence of your ability to work at the level of a professionally qualified youth worker; and prepare to demonstrate this as part of your tutor-marked assignments and in the final examination. As part of the research block you will identify an aspect of your practice, or an issue related to your practice, that you would like to investigate further and you will plan and begin to undertake a pilot study linked to this. You will also consider the relationship between policy and practice, how practitioners need to be able to respond to policy change and how they can work to find ways of influencing changes in policy. As part of this you will analyse an aspect of policy as it relates to your own practice and discuss aspects of policy with others. Throughout the course, you will develop skills in online learning and communications. You will have the opportunity to attend an optional Day School at the start of the course. This will introduce you to the innovative online nature of the course, and specifically to the online tools that you will use as part of your learning.</learningOutcome>
			<mlo:prerequisite>This is a Level 3 course. Level 3 courses build on study skills and subject knowledge acquired from previous studies at Levels 1 and 2. They are intended only for students who have recent experience of higher education in a related subject. You must complete the Level 2 work-based course Leading work with young people in practice (E218) before studying E318. We also strongly recommend that you study the Level 3 course Youth: perspectives and practice (KE308) before E318. As this course is a module of a qualification which conveys professional status, you will need to demonstrate that you meet the professional requirements as specified by the validating bodies in England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. You will need to complete a minimum of 176 hours of practice with young people over the duration of the course, and you will need to provide signed confirmation of this practice in order to successfully complete the course. This means working at least six hours a week in direct work with young people and an additional four and a half hours per week planning and evaluating your work with young people. If you do not have the same contact time with young people each week, this figure can be treated as an average. However, the contact must be on a regular rather than a sporadic basis, i.e. 164 hours over the duration of the course, but a minimum of just over twenty hours per month. You will need to: be working within an organisation in a suitable setting have support from your employer for your participation in the course have successfully passed through recruitment and induction processes within your organisation have successfully completed all appropriate vetting procedures for the country in which you are working (e.g. Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) check in England). It is the responsibility of you and your employer to ensure you meet these requirements, and not that of the OU. You should contact the relevant agency that deals with criminal records disclosure in your country for more information if you are in doubt about your eligibility, or to find out more have access to, or be able to obtain access to, the types of work required by the course (see Vocational relevance above) identify a person, or persons (in your workplace) to take on the role of: confirming that your evidence is authentic (the Confirmer) and providing supportive professional supervision (the Professional Supervisor). Your supervisor should be professionally (JNC or equivalent) qualified and have at least two years' post-qualifying experience. Further details of the requirements for studying E318 are contained in the Work-based Learning (WBL) Handbook available in electronic format on the Childhood and Youth Programme website, or alternatively from the Qualifications team on (01908) 653275. If you have any doubt about the suitability of the course, please contact our Student Registration &amp; Enquiry Service.</mlo:prerequisite>

			<dc:description>This diploma course will help put you on track for a career in fitness training, sports coaching or management. You'll develop work-related and academic skills that will enhance your performance and prospects at work - and if you want to carry on with your studies, you'll be able to top up to our BSc (Hons) degree. As well as increasing your current effectiveness as a coach or exercise instructor, the DipHE in Sport and Fitness will develop your understanding of sports science, training, leadership and management principles. Throughout your studies, you'll always come back to what matters most - applying science and theory to practice, and meeting the physical and psychological needs of the participant or client. You'll do this by using case studies and reflecting on real or potential work situations using film, text and online materials. In addition to your OU study, you'll need to identify and complete a UK-accredited qualification in either coaching or exercise instruction. This diploma of higher education will be of particular interest to those living and working in Scotland. The same programme of study is also offered as the Foundation Degree in Sport and Fitness (X07).</dc:description>

			<dc:description>This key introductory Level 1 course introduces the study of law and legal skills. It begins by looking at how rules develop within a society and how laws (in effect legal rules) are made, interpreted, and applied. Then, it examines the concepts of legal personality, unlawful conduct and states of mind. You will explore civil and criminal sanctions; issues raised by human rights legislation; and the concepts of rights and justice. Of particular interest as preparation for a law degree, the course also provides an excellent beginning if you wish to study other subjects. The course deals principally with the law of England and Wales.</dc:description>

In these circumstances, you must negotiate with your tutor to get their agreement to submit your assignment on paper. The assignments are an essential part of the course, so you should complete all of them. You will be given more detailed information about the assessment when you begin the course.</mlo:assessment>
			<mlo:prerequisite>This is a key introductory Level 1 course. Level 1 courses provide core subject knowledge and study skills needed for higher education and distance learning. If you are new or a less confident learner, start with Starting with law (Y186). This is an Openings course, also at Level 1 but worth 15 credits. Designed with lots of support and no examination, it will give you a gentle introduction to this subject and to OU study. If you successfully complete this Openings course, you should be ready to study W100. If you are a non-graduate studying towards the OU Bachelor of Laws (Hons) and expect to complete your degree after 2016, you must study Rules, rights and justice: an introduction to law as part of your degree. It will give you the foundation knowledge and study skills to study law at a more advanced level. By the end of the course you will be expected to be working at the level required of first-year undergraduate students. If you are a graduate you do not need to study this course as part of your law degree, although some graduates chose to do so as it gives a solid foundation for their later studies in law. If you have any doubt about the suitability of the course, please seek advice from our Student Registration &amp; Enquiry Service.</mlo:prerequisite>

			<dc:description>We live in a society that depends on science, but how many of us really understand the science behind the important issues that feature in the news? If you are fascinated by science but not yet sure whether your interest lies in - say - physics or biology, then this degree is for you. It starts with a fascinating, wide-ranging introduction to highly topical areas of modern science, and then offers the chance to specialise as you develop your interests. Pathways include biological and health sciences; chemistry and analytical sciences; Earth sciences; environmental science; physics; and astronomy and planetary science. Flexible, accessible study arrangements mean you can do all the practical work near where you live, or online in your own home - or you can opt to take part in laboratory and field work at specific locations.</dc:description>

			<learningOutcome>By the time you graduate, you'll be an adaptable scientist with a range of transferable skills that are highly valued in the labour market - such as analytical, numerical and communication skills, teamworking, problem solving and proficiency in using computers. You'll also have a good understanding of where your strengths and interests lie, and be well prepared for your next step - whether it's further study or employment. Science graduates are well placed to enter both scientific and non-scientific jobs. The logical, reasoned approach needed for science study is relevant to a wide range of financial, business and public sector employment, so science graduates - particularly those who have good communication and interpersonal skills - are in demand. Employers also look for evidence of experience of the workplace to support the skills gained through the degree. To succeed, graduates will need to be flexible and multi-skilled, with the ability to work in a multidisciplinary environment.

			<dc:description>How can we discover the plausible causes of riots and is lack of trust in politicians one explanation? Is childhood becoming eroded due to commercialisation and increased sexualisation? Does poverty lead to crime? Is economic growth compatible with protecting the environment?

			<mlo:prerequisite>This course is the first module in our Open University Business School masters degree programme. Normally, to register for this course you must have a UK honours degree or equivalent professional qualification, and have a minimum of three years' experience in a managerial, professional or technical role. Usually this means that you are at least 25 years old as it is unusual (but not impossible) to be able to satisfy the 'experience' requirement under this age. Experienced managers who do not meet the academic requirement can be accepted onto B716 if they first complete the Professional Certificate in Management (S01) (previously coded C31) which has open entry. If you have the equivalent of a UK bachelors degree without honours you may be permitted to progress on to the MBA or other masters qualification by taking the first module of the Professional Certificate in Management, Managing 1: organisations and people (B628). If you wish to study this course outside the EU you will need to register on the online version BZX628. Alternatively if you have an official Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT) score of 640 or above, and the equivalent of a UK bachelors degree, you will be allowed to progress directly on to the MBA. If you think either of these possibilities may apply to you, please contact our Student Registration &amp; Enquiry Service. You will also need an appropriate facility in English language, sufficient to be able to work effectively at postgraduate level; generally this means capability equivalent to an International English Language Test System (IELTS) score of 6.5. To assess your English language skills in relation to your proposed studies you can visit the IELTS website . If you are unsure whether your skill level in English is adequate you may find it helpful to look at our Skills for OU Study site. If you have any doubt about the suitability of the course, please contact our Student Registration &amp; Enquiry Service.</mlo:prerequisite>

			<dc:description>This course does not suggest that there are simple solutions, but puts forward concepts and analytical techniques that will help managers to make marketing decisions against a background of complexity and uncertainty. It expands into a broad discussion of complexity theory and its application to marketing strategy. You'll discuss external change drivers, focusing on economics and scenario planning, and deal with advanced marketing concepts and techniques - emphasising relationship marketing, and brand strategy and management. By the end, you'll be able to prepare strategic scenarios with an understanding of how relationships influence current marketing theory and the issues involved in marketing communications.</dc:description>

			<dc:description xsi:type="xcriTerms:careerOutcome">The course recognises the strong emphasis placed by students and their employers on the value of the effective practical application of course-based learning. B830 has, therefore, been designed to meet these requirements, particularly in relation to you developing and demonstrating a capability for critical and self-directed learning and a capability to apply masters-level learning integratively to real-world problems and opportunities. It is anticipated that the content of this course, especially the requirement to undertake and report on an evidence-based initiative, will make a significant contribution to a submission for accreditation by a professional body or to a portfolio for assessment. The course has been recognised by the Chartered Management Institute and gives exemption from some of the accreditation requirements in the Chartered Manager Programme. Some of your B830 work could be also used in the evidence required for a level 5 NVQ (in England, Wales and Northern Ireland) although we are not currently planning to provide a VQ Pathways Guide.</dc:description>
			<dc:description>This course consolidates your ability to make a real difference to organisational performance as a manager or leader. It should be studied towards the latter part of your study programme, as it builds on learning and assessment of previous courses. You'll undertake some preliminary work on the integration of theory, practice and learning before embarking on a largely self-directed programme focusing on a management initiative of your own choosing, in which we'll support you with resources and guidance. The course aims to enable you to make a difference in your own organisation and to enhance your own personal and professional development.</dc:description>

			<dc:description xsi:type="xcriTerms:careerOutcome">Managing financial risk will be of particular interest to you if you are working, or planning to work, in an organisation in the financial sector or in the finance division of a company or public sector/not-for-profit organisation. The subject matter of the course is, though, pertinent to managers and prospective managers whose immediate responsibilities are outside the domain of finance. Given the growing catalogue of risk failures in all sectors - and the growing emphasis being place on effective risk management by all organisations - the content of this course will provide knowledge and skills that all effective managers should possess.</dc:description>
			<dc:description>Managing financial risk explores the various financial risks that confront all institutions - credit risk, liquidity and refinancing risk, interest-rate risk, foreign exchange risk and operational risk. The course then examines how these risks can be both measured and managed. It uses many recent actual examples of risk management practices adopted in the public and private sectors - some good, some bad and some very ugly. By the end of the course you should have a full appreciation of how vulnerability to financial risks arises and how you, as a manager, can contribute to their effective management within your institution.</dc:description>

			<dc:description xsi:type="xcriTerms:careerOutcome">The course will provide approaches and tools relevant to all MBA students. It might have a particular relevance to you if you are working in or around government, e.g., as a government contractor, or in a highly-regulated industry.</dc:description>
			<dc:description>Many managers work in situations, or face tasks, for which the established toolkit of mainstream, Anglo-American management and leadership - with its 'command and control' assumptions, instrumentalism and strong financial focus - is inadequate. This course poses the question 'What do you do when management is inappropriate, not enough, doesn't work - or is simply not an option?'. You will explore a number of undercurrents in management thinking, and various alternatives to it - some longstanding, some recently developed. In particular, it will surface issues and questions that tend to be neglected or underplayed by the main management disciplines.</dc:description>

			<dc:description xsi:type="xcriTerms:careerOutcome">The course is specifically designed for those working in, or with experience of, an HR role, aiming to make them more effective in this role. It is not intended as a general interest course: if you lack an HR background you will have difficulty in completing assignments.</dc:description>
			<dc:description>This course develops the professional HR skills and expertise needed at both operational and strategic levels and in organisations where change and outsourcing are becoming the norm. These include practical, conceptual and critical skills - including those needed for effective continued professional development. You will address core HR areas (resourcing, employee relations, development, performance management and reward), setting these within wider organisational, professional, legal and ethical contexts, and considering how the HR profession is changing. You will also develop skills required to manage consultants, and to operate as an effective change agent and consultant yourself - activities which will feature in many HR careers.</dc:description>

Highly regarded by employers for its breadth and valued by students for its flexibility, the Open degree equips you with a wide range of expertise, skills and capabilities that are much sought after in today's highly competitive job market.

			<learningOutcome>The flexibility of the Open degree means that a range of careers and industries are open to you. Many graduates choose to enter careers that are not directly related to the subject(s) they studied and this is reflected in the fact that around 70 per cent of graduate jobs are open to graduates of any discipline. What makes Open degree students stand out is the rich view of the world they develop, the perspectives they encounter and the range of skills they develop from having studied a diverse range of subjects. Regardless of what you choose to study, the Open degree will let you successfully develop a range of transferable skills including: adaptability and flexibility problem solving communication and literacy numeracy information technology (IT) analysis and reporting critical analysis. There is more information about how OU study can improve your employability in the OU's Employability Statement from our Careers Advisory Service.

			<dc:description xsi:type="xcriTerms:careerOutcome">The course recognises the strong emphasis placed by students and their employers on the value of the effective practical application of course-based learning. BXH830 has, therefore, been designed to meet these requirements, particularly in relation to you developing and demonstrating a capability for critical and self-directed learning and a capability to apply masters-level learning integratively to real-world problems and opportunities. In particular, this HR-specific version of the more general Making a difference (B830) has been designed to meet the requirements of The Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD), the relevant UK professional Institute. It is anticipated that in addition to meeting the CIPD's requirements, coursework for BXH830 will potentially make a significant contribution to various forms of portfolio-based assessment. For example, this could be used in the evidence required for a level 5 NVQ (in England, Wales and Northern Ireland) although we are not currently planning to provide a VQ Pathways Guide.</dc:description>
			<dc:description>This course consolidates your ability to make a real difference to organisational performance as a manager or leader. It should be studied towards the latter part of your study programme, as it builds on learning and assessment of previous courses. You'll undertake some preliminary work on the integration of theory, practice and learning before embarking on a largely self-directed programme focusing on a management initiative of your own choosing, in which we'll support you with resources and guidance. The course aims to enable you to make a difference in your own organisation and to enhance your own personal and professional development.</dc:description>

			<dc:description>Middle and senior line managers meet a multiplicity of financial problems in their organisations. This course will interest those wanting to develop their knowledge of the area. It introduces finance and accounting problems that organisations face at board level, and enables you to feel at ease working with finance and accounting experts. You'll examine how finance and accounting interact (covering both public and private sector finance issues), develop a grasp of the fundamentals of corporate financial theory, and learn how to tackle the main financial problems you are likely to encounter. You'll also be able to understand and analyse company accounts in different situations.</dc:description>

			<dc:description>This course does not suggest that there are simple solutions, but puts forward concepts and analytical techniques that will help managers to make marketing decisions against a background of complexity and uncertainty. It expands into a broad discussion of complexity theory and its application to marketing strategy. You'll discuss external change drivers, focusing on economics and scenario planning, and deal with advanced marketing concepts and techniques - emphasising relationship marketing, and brand strategy and management. By the end, you'll be able to prepare strategic scenarios with an understanding of how relationships influence current marketing theory and the issues involved in marketing communications.</dc:description>

			<dc:description xsi:type="xcriTerms:careerOutcome">The course recognises the strong emphasis placed by students and their employers on the value of the effective practical application of course-based learning. BZX830 has, therefore, been designed to meet these requirements, particularly in relation to you developing and demonstrating a capability for critical and self-directed learning and a capability to apply masters-level learning integratively to real-world problems and opportunities. It is anticipated that the content of this course, especially the requirement to undertake and report on an evidence-based initiative will make a significant contribution to a submission for accreditation by a professional body or to a portfolio for assessment. For example, this could be used in the evidence required for a level 5 NVQ (in England, Wales and Northern Ireland) although we are not currently planning to provide a VQ Pathways Guide.</dc:description>
			<dc:description>This course consolidates your ability to make a real difference to organisational performance as a manager or leader. It should be studied towards the latter part of your study programme, as it builds on learning and assessment of previous courses. You'll undertake some preliminary work on the integration of theory, practice and learning before embarking on a largely self-directed programme focusing on a management initiative of your own choosing, in which we'll support you with resources and guidance. The course aims to enable you to make a difference in your own organisation and to enhance your own personal and professional development.</dc:description>

			<learningOutcome>This certificate is ideal if you want to develop your knowledge and understanding of the primary curriculum and your ability to support children's learning in primary schools. It can be studied either as a qualification in its own right or as the first step in your studies towards the Foundation Degree in Primary Teaching and Learning or Diploma of Higher Education in Primary Teaching and Learning. You can also count it towards a degree (for example, the BA (Hons) Childhood and Youth Studies or other degrees that allow free choice of modules for some or all of the credits).

			<dc:description>If you're thinking about teacher training but would find a traditional full-time course difficult or impossible, the Open University's Professional Graduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) - graded 'outstanding' in recent inspections - could be the answer. Our modular PCGE leads to Qualified Teacher Status in England and Wales, and Eligibility to Teach in Northern Ireland and offers a flexible alternative to conventional university courses. You can study on a part-time or full-time basis, taking up to two years, at a pace to suit your circumstances. You'll study the theory of teaching and learning through supported open learning, which you'll apply in practice during sustained periods of teaching in a partner school, local to where you live. We offer six PGCE subjects at secondary level: design and technology; geography; mathematics; modern foreign languages (French, German and Spanish); music; and science (biology, chemistry and physics). If you're in Scotland, you can study for the Professional Graduate Diploma in Education (V16), currently available only for secondary mathematics. Entry requirements The requirements may change as a result of government decisions. At present you must: Be able to attend school placements in England, Wales or Northern Ireland. Be resident in the appropriate nation. Have a degree from a UK university or an equivalent qualification that is clearly and substantially relevant to one of the six secondary PGCE subjects. This means that at least half and preferably two-thirds of your degree (at least 180 credits) should comprise studies relevant to the subject you intend to teach. Have a GCSE grade A-C, or the equivalent, in English language and in mathematics. Show evidence in your application and at interview that you can communicate clearly and grammatically in written and spoken standard English. Demonstrate at interview specific abilities related to the subject. If you are applying for a place in modern foreign languages, you will need to be able to offer two languages, one of which must be French.</dc:description>

			<learningOutcome>The Professional Graduate Certificate in Education is a programme of initial teacher education (ITE) that complies with relevant nation-state requirements. It leads directly to Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) conferred by the GTCE in England; QTS conferred by the GTCW in Wales; and 'Eligibility to Teach' conferred by the Department of Education (NI) in Northern Ireland. This PGCE course equips you with the skills, knowledge and understanding to become an effective secondary school teacher. It fosters a reflective approach to classroom teaching - bringing together learning from academic study with the practice learning that takes place during school placements; enabling you to establish links and relationships between them; and encouraging you to reflect on how they shape your learning and professional development. If you live in England, and are considering whether a career in teaching is for you, the Training and Development Agency's School Experience Programme (SEP) offers 1 to 10 days' classroom experience in a secondary school. For details, please check the TDA's website . If you're a student in higher education in Wales and would like guidance on whether secondary school teaching suits you before applying for a PGCE, we offer a taster course called Prepare to Teach . For details contact Clare Schroder on +44(0) 29 2047 1019 or send her an email .

			<abstract>A valuable qualification in its own right, or the first step in a programme of mathematics study leading to a postgraduate diploma or an MS</abstract>
			<learningOutcome>Mathematics is at the heart of advances in science, engineering and technology, as well as being an indispensable problem-solving and decision-making tool in many other areas of life. It is no surprise therefore that mathematics postgraduates can be found throughout industry, business and commerce, in the public and private sectors. Employers value the intellectual rigour and reasoning skills that mathematics students can acquire, their familiarity with numerical and symbolic thinking and the analytic approach to problem-solving which is their hallmark. There are a variety of reasons for studying mathematics at postgraduate level. You may want a postgraduate qualification in order to distinguish yourself from an increasingly large graduate population. You may find, particularly if you are a professional programmer or work in finance, that your undergraduate mathematical knowledge is becoming insufficient for your career requirements, especially if you are hoping to specialise in one of the more mathematical areas, which are becoming more sought after by employers. The extent of opportunities is vast and mathematics postgraduates are equipped with skills and knowledge required for jobs in fields such as finance, education, engineering, science and business, as well as mathematics and mathematical science research. There is more information about how OU study can improve your employability in the OU's Employability Statement from our Careers Advisory Service.

			<dc:description>Are you interested in what shapes the lives we lead and the decisions we make? Have you wondered why people continue to smoke when they know the risks, or why governments want to reorganise the NHS? Social scientists build theories and conduct research to understand why and how people, groups and institutions respond to change, exercise power and make decisions. The Certificate of Higher Education in Social Sciences provides a compelling introduction to social science approaches, and a springboard to further study. You'll gain fascinating insights into everyday life in our communities, personal lives and workplaces, drawing on ideas from sociology, economics, social policy, psychology, geography, criminology, and politics. This certificate course will also develop a range of skills centring on the effective use of analysis and written argument that will be valuable at work and in your personal life. You'll have your own specialist, subject-based academic support as well as opportunities to join in online communities of other social sciences students for teaching, learning and peer support.</dc:description>

			<dc:description xsi:type="xcriTerms:careerOutcome">Whilst this course does not qualify students to practise counselling, it does meet the needs of new students who wish to complete a 'taster course' in order to determine whether counselling is a suitable career, as recommended by the British Association of Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP). It also provides academic and practical learning of relevance to many others - for instance, those in business or other professions where 'people skills' are particularly important - who are seeking further knowledge and training in basic counselling theory and skills.</dc:description>
			<dc:description>The tremendous expansion of counselling over the last 20 years reflects the changing nature of society, an increase in the number of people perceiving a need for professional help with their problems, and a growing recognition of the value of such support. This 12-week online course provides an accessible and interesting introduction to the theory and practice of counselling. While the course is primarily theoretical, it also develops some awareness of the basic skills in counselling practice. You will get a good grounding in key topics in counselling, including its cultural and historical origins; different theoretical orientations; and the vital role of the counselling relationship.</dc:description>

If you have any questions about your eligibility for this qualification please contact the Credit, Qualifications and Ceremonies Centre on +44(0) 1908 653003 or by email . It is clear from international debate, not least the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (the 'Earth' summit) in Rio de Janeiro, that there is some danger of polarisation between the two topics of environment and development. Richer northern countries may seem more concerned about environment and poorer southern ones about development, when enlightened concern about global human welfare must surely involve both. This diploma course encourages you to consider the two topics together. It is a suitable qualification if you do not want to complete a full degree or if you want to obtain an interim qualification on your way to a full degree.</dc:description>

			<dc:description xsi:type="xcriTerms:careerOutcome">This course does not qualify students to practise counselling, but it is a compulsory module in the Foundation Degree in Counselling. It provides key knowledge and skills for those seeking careers in all areas of applied psychology, and provides academic and practical learning of relevance to many others - for instance, those in business or other professions where 'people skills' are particularly important - who are seeking further knowledge and training in counselling theory and skills.</dc:description>
			<dc:description>Fear and sadness are the most common problems that people seek counselling for. This course introduces you to the ways in which they have been understood: as 'mental health problems'; by different forms of individual therapy; and by approaches that focus on the family, the social group, or society. While the course is primarily academic, you'll develop awareness of counselling skills, processes and techniques. The main sections of the course cover: historical developments in understanding fear and sadness; key individual counselling approaches; approaches that consider relationships and cultural aspects of human suffering; and the practice and evaluation of counselling.</dc:description>

			<mlo:prerequisite>D240 is a Level 2 course that provides core subject knowledge and study skills. It builds on the themes covered in the Level 1 course Introduction to counselling (D171), but it is not a requirement to study this Level 1 course first. If you are new to study at university level, or haven't studied for some time, we strongly recommend that you study a Level 1 course first before Level 2. As this course can lead to a professionally recognised qualification in counselling, and some aspects of the course content and activities are unsuitable for students under the age of eighteen years, entry is only open to students over the age of eighteen at course start date. Although we support students in the learning of this subject, please note that your tutor is not there to help with your own life or personal difficulties. This is not a function that this course can fulfil. If you have any doubt about the suitability of the course, please contact our Student Registration &amp; Enquiry Service.</mlo:prerequisite>

			<learningOutcome>Managing development gets ever more complex, as more agencies become involved, new goals emerge, complementing and confronting existing goals, and the right of 'beneficiaries' to participate in their own development is increasingly asserted. This diploma addresses the challenge of this complexity. The core modules give practitioners the opportunity to strengthen their policy development and project management skills. They put inter-organisational relationships at the heart of development management, offering a framework for analysing existing relationships and for making strategic decisions about relationships that are required, and covering skills - mapping and modelling, negotiating and brokering - that contribute to the building of relationships. The diploma thus equips practitioners to negotiate good change more effectively.

			<dc:description xsi:type="xcriTerms:careerOutcome">Changing cities responds to a growing range of practical demands to shape the places where we live or work, and caters to the growth of vocations concerned with many different aspects of place-making. Whether it is as planners or urban managers, householders or citizens, advocates or activists, or in the context of community or private enterprise, there are numerous opportunities for intervening positively in place-making processes. Employers are increasingly placing great value on trained graduates who are able to demonstrate initiative and work independently. You will develop and refine transferable research and study skills, and advance your capacity to identify, research and present complex issues. The course keeps in mind that, sooner or later, local decision-makers are likely to be confronted with new and unanticipated issues - whether environmental, economic or cultural. The skills and the ways of looking at the world that are the crux of Changing cities are intended to help you engage critically and creatively with a future that will not only deliver familiar challenges but will undoubtedly come with some surprises.</dc:description>
			<dc:description>How are cities responding to environmental change, economic instability, limited resources and other challenges? Can we make the towns, cities or neighbourhoods we live in fairer, safer and more fulfilling? This course looks at place-making decisions faced by planners, urban managers, activists and ordinary people. You will be introduced to forms of spatial and political thinking in relation to topical issues. Changing cities will guide you in the development of your own specialist area of decision making. You will develop independent research skills and put them into practice in relation to an urban or place-making issue of your own choosing.</dc:description>

			<dc:description xsi:type="xcriTerms:careerOutcome">The course has been developed to combine theory and practice. It will provide you with up-to-date information on new developments within the field. The course book and study guide, including a statistical refresher, can also prepare you to complete the theory-based competencies necessary to gain British Psychological Society psychometric testing qualifications (Levels A &amp; B). An additional external face to face course presented by a leading test development organisation is available to enable you to gain the practical competencies required for the British Psychological Society psychometric testing qualifications. This course, for which there is a separate fee payable, lasts five days in total and is designed to be completed within two years of beginning D842. It complements D842 by providing you with an opportunity to develop and practice the skills of test administration, interpretation and feedback for both ability and personality tests. If you successfully complete this additional study you will be able to register with the British Psychological Society as a psychometric test user.</dc:description>
			<dc:description>This course explores the key psychological ideas behind selection and recruitment policy and practice. You'll consider the major tools and techniques of selection (and their applications in a global market), and compare their underlying assumptions, identifying advantages and disadvantages for a range of stakeholders, including individual candidates, human resources professionals, employing organisations, and wider society. You'll review current advances in theory and practice and assess changes, such as the use of the internet in attracting and testing applicants, and their potential impact.</dc:description>

			<mlo:prerequisite>The minimum entry requirement is a recognised UK honours degree or its equivalent. Although the honours degree can be in any subject, you are unlikely to be prepared for this module if you have not had a prior academic grounding in the social sciences or psychology. This is because your postgraduate studies will assume you are familiar with social scientific or psychological language and concepts, and the characteristic ways in which social scientists and psychologists construct arguments, use theory and handle evidence. Before you start your postgraduate studies it is expected that you will have the ability to: write accurately, clearly and concisely read large quantities of text quickly, accurately and critically classify evidence precisely, and assess its value and reliability argue logically, consistently and sceptically marshal evidence to support a logical argument. All our postgraduate modules are taught in English, so your spoken and written English must be of an appropriate standard for postgraduate study. If you're not sure whether your English skills are good enough, there is some help and guidance on our website . Although a brief refresher is offered, it is important that you are competent in basic statistical concepts and techniques, including: frequency distribution; mean, mode, median and standard deviations; standard error of measurement; percentiles and z-scores; and correlations. To continue to the later practical components it will be necessary for you to demonstrate your competence in these areas. Before taking this course, it is expected that you will have already studied the postgraduate foundation course for the qualification you are studying towards, one of D821, D822 or D820 (all now discontinued). Please refer to the relevant qualification description. If you have any doubt about the suitability of the course, or whether your subject knowledge and study skills are adequate for study at this level, please contact the Learner Support Team, Postgraduate Studies in Social Sciences (telephone +44(0)113 234 1225, or email ).</mlo:prerequisite>

			<dc:description xsi:type="xcriTerms:careerOutcome">The analysis of qualitative data, texts and interview material is a key research skill and a crucial part of training in research methods for the social sciences and other academic disciplines. It is a central part of the curriculum in psychological research methods degrees, and is required by professional and funding bodies such as the British Psychological Society and the Economic and Social Research Council. The use of discourse analysis is growing in other contexts such as market research, media analysis, communication training, advertising, policy research and public relations.</dc:description>
			<dc:description>The role of language is increasingly important for social researchers. This course reviews the varied traditions around meaning-making, including socio-linguistics, conversation analysis, critical discourse analysis, discursive psychology and genealogical research. You'll learn methods of discourse analysis and how to work with various kinds of research data, including official documents, conversations and interviews. You'll also debate the ideas of key thinkers such as Wittgenstein, Austin, Sacks, Saussure and Foucault, and discuss the tensions between schools of thought.</dc:description>

			<dc:description xsi:type="xcriTerms:careerOutcome">Ethnography and related qualitative research approaches are important across the social sciences and related disciplines, such as education and development studies. This course provides essential training in research methods for advanced students, especially those who intend to take advanced degrees. In professional and commercial contexts, it is relevant to anyone who has to collect and analyse qualitative data (through interviews, for instance) or to evaluate studies and reports based on such data.</dc:description>
			<dc:description>Ethnography is a broad approach to research characterised by the central role of the researcher and the use of multiple data collection methods, including interviewing and observation. Ethnographers try to get 'inside' social worlds and see them 'through the eyes' of research subjects in order to understand and explain them in all their richness, complexity and specificity. This course introduces ethnographic research and guides you through project design, data collection and data analysis.</dc:description>

			<dc:description xsi:type="xcriTerms:careerOutcome">Universities are keen to admit doctoral research students who have completed most of their research training, finding them better prepared to begin and better able to complete their theses in the required time. This course provides some of that training in research methods and skills for advanced students. There is growing professional and commercial demand for highly qualified graduates who have a range of transferable skills. The course is particularly useful preparation for environments in which research is a significant part of the work, and for any profession that requires numerate and skilled researchers who have experience of a wide range of methods.</dc:description>
			<dc:description>Researching and writing a dissertation will enable you to consolidate and apply the skills and knowledge gained in earlier postgraduate study. You'll undertake independent research on a topic chosen in consultation with your tutor. Depending on your earlier subject choices, you may undertake an ethnography or discourse analysis, a survey, or an experiment. In some subjects, research may be literature based rather than empirical. You'll complete staged assignments to help with planning and production, before writing up your research in a dissertation of up to 15,000 words. This course requires extensive preparatory work and early registration is strongly recommended.</dc:description>

			<mlo:prerequisite>As D845 must be the last module you take when following the dissertation route in relevant qualifications, you will need to have already gained the appropriate 120 credits towards your qualification. You will be asked to provide a synopsis of your research topic, so that we can allocate you to an appropriate supervisor. You will not be allowed to progress to the course start if your topic is considered unsuitable for a masters-level dissertation in research methods, or if we are unable to find an appropriate supervisor. Every endeavour will be made to find supervision for students' choice of topics, but we reserve the right to require a change of topic if appropriate supervision cannot be provided. If you have any doubt about the suitability of the course, please contact the Learner Support Team, Postgraduate Studies in Social Sciences (telephone +44 (0)113 234 1225, or email ). There are specific requirements for each of the masters-level research methods programmes: MSc in Management and Business Research Methods : Your choice of topics for the dissertation should be drawn from current research within the broad field of management and business studies. Your choice of methodology should be based on those you have studied in previous courses in this masters degree, and should be appropriate for the research question(s) you wish to address. MSc in Psychological Research Methods: Your choice of topic must be selected from the broad area of either cognitive or social psychology, but could be in an applied area of either of those two branches. Your choice of methodology must be appropriate to your research question. The vocational relevance of this programme includes professional branches of psychology such as clinical, educational, health, occupational and research psychology, as well as careers in personnel management, market research and so on. MSc in Educational Technology Research Methods : You will need to choose a topic from a broad range of areas that are currently being investigated by the Institute of Educational Technology's Research Groups, see their website . (Note that the HERG group is now part of the larger Higher Education Policy and Practice Research Group (HEPPRG) which brings together those in the University with an interest in research into higher education, its activities will include policy-related research on issues to do with management and governance and practice related research on issues to do with teaching, learning and assessment). MSc in Social Research Methods: We anticipate that most projects within this programme are likely to be drawing on either a sociological or a social policy orientation. Further guidance about possible topics will be available to you via the dedicated D845 website, to which you will have access as soon as you register for the course. The vocational relevance of this programme includes various branches of social policy, welfare, health, occupational, market and social research. MSc in Technology Strategy Research: Your choice of topic can be from a broad range of areas including environmental policy and management, technology policy, innovation, and organisations and institutions, including particular issues that arise from different development contexts (North/South). Your choice of methodology should be based on those you have encountered during the courses in this masters degree, and should be coherent with your research question. MA in Social Policy and Criminology : Your choice of topic must relate to a current debate in social policy or criminology.</mlo:prerequisite>

If you're not sure whether your English skills are good enough, there is some help and guidance at our Skills for OU Study website. It is expected that you will have already completed one of the foundation courses for social sciences postgraduate study, either D821, D822 or D820 (all now discontinued) before you study D867. If you have any doubt about the suitability of this course or whether your subject knowledge and skills are adequate for study at this level, please contact the Learner Support Team, Postgraduate Studies in Social Sciences (telephone +44 (0)113 234 1225 or email ).</mlo:prerequisite>

			<abstract>This course explores important and fascinating questions and issues in the psychology of crime, offenders and policing</abstract>
			<learningOutcome>The course topics are organised into three blocks. Block 1 looks at theories of crime and explanations for offending behaviours, including crimes committed by young offenders, the role of mental illness and criminal psychopathy. Block 2 considers the psychology of specific types of crime, focusing on violent offences and offenders, including domestic, sexual and political violence. Block 3 shifts the focus to how psychology has been applied to police investigations of crimes, exploring offender profiling, the psychology of police interviewing, suspects' confessions and lie detection. The course takes a guided learning approach, based around two course books and a substantial amount of independent learning. You will be reading material from a variety of leading authors in the field, with the aid of a specially prepared online study guide. Course Book 1 is a custom-published version of Dennis Howitt's Introduction to Forensic and Criminal Psychology (3rd Edition) produced specially for this course, including additional material written specifically for D872. This book provides week-by-week introductions to the course topics at a level suitable for both psychology students (with or without any prior knowledge of forensic psychology) and students from other disciplines, such as criminology. Course Book 2 takes the form of a reader, consisting of published research and review articles illustrating specific aspects of each topic. These articles have been carefully selected to develop your knowledge and understanding of particular legal and psychological contexts, research methods, legal, practical and ethical issues, and implications for both theory and practice. You will build upon this core material with independent learning, using The Open University's extensive online library resources to conduct literature-based research into the course topics. There will also be a number of resources provided via the course's Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) to support your learning and skills development. The VLE resources will include audio material, learning activities, a discussion forum and a course glossary. The assessment on this course has a strongly applied focus, and aims to develop and test your transferable skills as well as your subject knowledge. You will apply both theoretical and empirical knowledge from published psychological sources to realistic (albeit hypothetical) scenarios relevant to real-world contexts in forensic psychology (Note: you will not be required to conduct empirical research yourself as part of this course). You will develop your skills of literature searching, summarising a range of sources and critically evaluating psychological theory and research. You will present your work in a variety of styles including essay and report formats suitable for different audiences, such as academic and non-academic professional bodies.</learningOutcome>
			<mlo:prerequisite>The minimum entry requirement is a recognised UK honours degree or its equivalent. Although the honours degree can be in any subject, you are unlikely to be prepared for this course if you have not had a prior academic grounding in the social sciences or psychology. This is because your postgraduate studies will assume you are familiar with social scientific or psychological language and concepts, and the characteristic ways in which social scientists and psychologists construct arguments, use theory and handle evidence. In consequence, if you do not have an honours degree that includes a substantial amount of social scientific or psychological content, we would strongly advise you to consider studying at least one Open University third level undergraduate social sciences or psychology course before you embark on postgraduate study. Before you start your postgraduate studies it is expected that you will have the ability to: write accurately, clearly and concisely read large quantities of text quickly, accurately and critically classify evidence precisely, and assess its value and reliability argue logically, consistently and sceptically marshal evidence to support a logical argument. All our postgraduate courses are taught in English, so your spoken and written English must be of an appropriate standard for postgraduate study. If you're not sure whether your English skills are good enough, there is some help and guidance on our website . Before taking this course, it is expected that you will have already studied the postgraduate foundation course for the qualification you are studying towards, one of D821, D822 or D820 (all now discontinued). Please refer to the relevant qualification description. If you have any doubt about the suitability of the course, or whether your subject knowledge and study skills are adequate for study at this level, please contact the Learner Support Team, Postgraduate Studies in Social Sciences (telephone +44 (0)113 234 1225, or email ).</mlo:prerequisite>

			<dc:description xsi:type="xcriTerms:careerOutcome">This course is appropriate if you wish to understand or manage your own investments. However, it also has particular relevance if you are working in, or aiming to work in, the financial services industry. It teaches crucial knowledge and skills supporting investment planning, and encourages a thoughtful and ethical approach to their application. It is a compulsory module in the Foundation Degree in Financial Services and Diploma of Higher Education in Financial Services.</dc:description>
			<dc:description>Why, where and how should I invest? How are these decisions affected by economic uncertainty? What is the relationship between risk and return? These are some of the questions addressed in Personal investment in an uncertain world . Investment planning requires financial decisions about the allocation of resources in a world of uncertainties that affect the value of pensions, shares and bonds. You'll learn how to understand the sources of uncertainty, the way that financial service providers adapt to it and how individuals form personal strategies to manage it.</dc:description>

			<dc:description>This key introductory Level 1 course is an ideal introduction to the social sciences - psychology, social policy and criminology, geography and environment, politics and international studies, economics and sociology - through study of contemporary UK society. Using a blend of text, audio, DVD and online materials, you'll explore a wide range of topics, including questions of society's relationship to the environment, questions of identity and issues of social order and governance - all considered in their national and international contexts - that will equip you with a range of skills for independent study and for your personal and working life.</dc:description>

			<mlo:assessment>For TMAs 01 - 06, you can choose whether to submit your tutor-marked assignments (TMAs) on paper or online through the eTMA system. You may want to use the eTMA system for some of your assignments but submit on paper for others. This is entirely your choice, but the final TMA, TMA 07, must be submitted online through the eTMA system. Assessment is an essential part of the teaching, so you are expected to complete it all. But if you unavoidably miss or do badly in an assignment, some courses allow you a 'substitution score'. In DD101 this rule can apply to one assignment. You will be given more detailed information when you begin the course.</mlo:assessment>
			<learningOutcome>You will learn about the nature of the social sciences and the ways they develop through a process of questions, arguments, evidence and evaluation. You will also learn about some key issues and debates at the centre of life in the contemporary UK. You'll develop an awareness of a range of different disciplinary approaches in the social sciences. You will gain confidence and skills in studying and accessing information from a range of sources; constructing arguments; reading, interpreting and evaluating evidence; and presenting and communicating ideas and information in a variety of formats. You will also practice how to manage your time effectively and organise and complete a programme of work, how to learn from feedback and reflect on your own learning and have an opportunity to plan a study pathway leading to personal and/or career goals.</learningOutcome>
			<mlo:prerequisite>This is a key introductory Level 1 course. Level 1 courses provide core subject knowledge and study skills needed for both higher education and distance learning, to help you progress to courses at Level 2. You are strongly advised to start your OU studies with a Level 1 course - either this course or the two 30-credit courses Introducing the social sciences - part one (DD131) followed by Introducing the social sciences - part two (DD132). As interdisciplinary approaches to the social sciences and because of their integrated teaching of key study and skills, these courses provide a firm foundation for further study at Level 2. If you are new or a less confident learner, start with either Starting with psychology (Y183), Understanding children and young people (Y176) or Understanding society (Y177). These are Openings courses, also at Level 1 but worth 15 credits. Designed with lots of support and no examination, they will give you a gentle introduction to this subject and to OU study. If you successfully complete one of these Openings courses, you'll be ready to study DD101. Alternatively, if you're unsure whether social sciences is for you, try our diagnostic quiz at Are you ready for DD101? to help you decide. You can also find more information about the course, including frequently asked questions. If you have any doubt about the suitability of the course, please contact our Student Registration &amp; Enquiry Service.</mlo:prerequisite>

			<dc:description>This lively introduction to contemporary sociology contains four modules, beginning with Understanding everyday life , which illuminates everyday aspects of the social world, including the home and pub. Next, Social divisions and differences examines the social divisions of race, class and gender, exploring their relationship to debates about citizenship and social justice. Social change introduces an historical perspective by considering changes in the temporal and spatial organisation of social life, in nations and cities, for example. Finally, The uses of sociology introduces different approaches to doing sociology, including methods.</dc:description>

			<dc:description xsi:type="xcriTerms:careerOutcome">The analytical and technical skills of economics have wide application in many fields where reasoned argument, clarity of thought and use of quantitative evidence are important. A knowledge of economic theory and economic processes is also advantageous for many jobs in both the private and public sectors. Economics is valuable in any job that requires understanding of how markets operate, such as marketing and other aspects of business. Economic analysis is also essential for policy-related activities in environmental, social or industrial policy, in national or local government and in campaigning organisations. ICT skills are an increasingly valuable asset in a wide range of occupations.</dc:description>
			<dc:description>This introduction to contemporary economics explores national and global debates such as: Are we living through a new, ICT-led industrial revolution? What are the economic outcomes of globalisation? Is capitalism environmentally sustainable? Do governments really have the will and capacity to redistribute income? You will investigate a wide range of issues in economic theory including innovation; economic policy and competition; firms' decision making; market structures; the changing role of the state; poverty and international trade; unemployment and inflation; economic forecasting; and managing the national economy. The course will also enhance your ICT skills through its innovative, multimedia teaching approach, which includes a 'virtual classroom'.</dc:description>

			<mlo:prerequisite>This course is suitable both as a broad introduction to economics for those who want to take only one course in the subject, and as a good basis for further study in economics. You are not expected to have taken any courses in economics, or to have any knowledge or experience of ICT. Nevertheless this is a Level 2 course and you need the general study techniques appropriate to Level 2 study in the social sciences: reading actively engaging with the argument of the text and taking notes the ability to extract information from different sources, including numerical tables and graphs handling evidence in support of arguments making critical analyses of topics and of different views of them. The course does not assume that you have mathematics beyond elementary arithmetic, introducing additional techniques including graphs, economics diagrams, elementary algebraic equations to express economic relationships, and basic data analysis. You should be interested in developing skills in basic mathematics as part of the toolkit of economics, in learning the techniques and in handling abstract forms of argument.

			<dc:description xsi:type="xcriTerms:careerOutcome">Courses in government and politics are relevant to a wide range of employment. Politics graduates can be found in all financial and commercial occupations - such as business management, banking and insurance - and in a variety of other professions, including the law and accountancy. They are particularly attracted to the public sector - the civil service, local government and health administration.</dc:description>
			<dc:description>Tumultuous events like 9/11 and the war in Iraq have reminded people how vital - and sometimes how deadly - the world of politics can be. Even at the very local level, the everyday politics of petitioning, local council debate, and of schools and hospitals affects people's lives. This course invites you into the world of politics in a fresh and accessible way, using a wide variety of case studies drawn from the UK and beyond. It sheds light on the inner workings of power, decision making and protest, and it covers politics from parliament to the street, and the politics of ideas as well as institutions.</dc:description>

			<dc:description xsi:type="xcriTerms:careerOutcome">The course gives a general introduction to geographical and environmental issues and will support training towards a range of vocational interests and careers. The appeal of geography stems from its broadly based and multidisciplinary flavour; it is highly regarded as part of a general preparation for more specifically vocational courses or job training. Traditionally, geography has been seen as useful to careers in planning, local government, architecture, surveying, environmental management and teaching, but you should also consider it if you are thinking about jobs in business, transport and communications, health care or politics. Geography teachers and those working in environment-related activities should find the course adds significant value to their work and careers, as will those working for a range of international organisations, either social, economic or political.</dc:description>
			<dc:description>It is commonplace now to say that the world has gone global. Whenever we buy food and clothes, listen to music, or watch the news, we can see how different parts of the world, often thousands of miles apart, are connected together. And with these multiple and various connections comes a sense of the world as being a complex and exciting place. This course will help you to understand that complexity, giving you some key geographical concepts which help to make sense of the processes and patterns shaping our globalised world.</dc:description>

			<dc:description xsi:type="xcriTerms:careerOutcome">This course offers a comprehensive grounding in interdisciplinary social science, suitable for a variety of qualification pathways and provides opportunities to develop skills that will be of vital importance in current or future careers. Further study in the social sciences could open up employment opportunities in a wide range of occupations in business; banking; insurance; education; health professions; administration; law; social services; voluntary and campaigning organisations; the media; public relations; public service organisations and government (national and local); planning and environmental management; criminal justice system; and social welfare organisations. The course provides a set of transferable skills and aptitudes that are relevant to many other career pathways.</dc:description>
			<dc:description>This interdisciplinary course investigates the role of social science in making sense of everyday dilemmas such as sustaining relationships, making a living, finding a place to live, being part of a community, or making one's voice heard. The course explores how social scientists use evidence and data, theories and explanations, and norms and values to make sense of social life. By studying this course you will develop the practical transferable skills and intellectual resources required to analyse the different ways in which social science is used both to understand and to shape our social lives.</dc:description>

			<dc:description xsi:type="xcriTerms:careerOutcome">Welfare, crime and society is relevant to a wide range of jobs in the public, voluntary, community and commercial sectors. The areas and themes the course looks at are directly relevant to a variety of jobs in public administration, health, education, social welfare services and criminal justice services, amongst others. The analytical and key skills you will develop are relevant to any job context. Amongst the 'transferable' skills you will develop are: the ability to identify, gather, analyse and assess evidence; present reasoned and coherent arguments; write clearly in a range of styles such as essays, reports and policy reviews; apply learning to non-course provided examples and situations; and plan and reflect on your own work and learning.</dc:description>
			<dc:description>This course examines the relationships between the worlds of social welfare and crime control. It focuses on policy interventions and responses in the UK and around the world to issues such as anti-social behaviour, poverty, discrimination, hate crimes, child labour, health and disease, families, slums, ghettos and gated communities. Using multi-media teaching materials, the course is organised by four conceptual themes - surveillance, social justice, security and community. It will equip you with the skills you need to select and evaluate evidence in relation to social science arguments and social policy.</dc:description>

			<dc:description xsi:type="xcriTerms:careerOutcome">This course is for anyone who has a serious interest in studying one of society's most pressing social problems at a local and global level. It is of professional relevance for those who work for, or who wish to work for, the agencies of the criminal justice system, or for organisations concerned with the care and resettlement of offenders, civil liberties, human rights, social justice, victim support, crime prevention, community safety and conflict resolution.</dc:description>
			<dc:description>Crime, disorder, and justice are increasingly pressing concerns across the world. Fear of crime and proliferating global threats contribute to an increasing sense of insecurity. Local concerns - for example street crime - are now accompanied by twenty-first century global concerns about human trafficking, cyber-crime, terrorism and human rights violations to name but a few. These 'threats' have implications for justice, as the boundaries between crime control and civil liberties are being increasingly redrawn. You'll explore crime and justice in both global and local contexts, and in particular the way that crime and justice are being continually redefined by global economic, social and political change.</dc:description>

			<dc:description xsi:type="xcriTerms:careerOutcome">A knowledge of psychology is considered useful in professions ranging from marketing to personnel work. An understanding of research techniques and statistical methods is also a sought-after skill, with relevance outside the immediate area of psychology. If you take DD303 as part of a complete set of psychology courses, such that you can gain professional recognition, many kinds of psychological work may be open to you - the prison service, educational psychology, applied (workplace) psychology, for example - although many professions require further, postgraduate training.</dc:description>
			<dc:description>How does memory work? How do we understand language? How do we think? These are just some of the questions related to everyday experience you'll address on this course. Beginning with core topics - perception and attention; categorisation and language; and memory, thinking and reasoning - you'll then explore wider issues, such as emotion and consciousness, topics that have presented a challenge to the cognitive approach. Throughout, you'll be asked to examine theories, evidence and arguments as well as the methods of cognitive psychology, including neuropsychology and neuroimaging. Using a computer, you'll also be guided through techniques of data analysis and experimentation, and will engage in your own project work.</dc:description>

			<dc:description xsi:type="xcriTerms:careerOutcome">This course has relevance to a wide range of employment since it offers students the opportunity to develop transferable skills, such as report writing and interviewing, and will help you plan and design your own work. It would be most valuable for people who work, or want to work, in social welfare, health care or public service settings such as the criminal justice system and various voluntary organisations. The skills developed through the course are also relevant to administration and management in the commercial and service sectors.</dc:description>
			<dc:description>How has social policy influenced ideas and values about parenthood? How far can we legitimise locking children in secure accommodation in order to 'care' for them? How have 'welfare to work' initiatives changed the meaning of 'work' in social policy? How does social policy construct the lives of refugees and asylum seekers? This course uses four key themes - Sexualities, Care, Work, and Citizenship - to explore how individuals shape and are shaped by policy making and welfare practices and how social policy is organised, represented and experienced - opening up challenging questions about the policymaking process both in the past and in contemporary society.</dc:description>

			<dc:description xsi:type="xcriTerms:careerOutcome">Courses in government and politics are relevant to a wide range of employment. Politics graduates can be found in financial and commercial occupations - such as business management, banking and insurance - and in a variety of other professions, including the law and accountancy. They are particularly attractive to the public sector: the civil service, local government and health administration.</dc:description>
			<dc:description>Should religious beliefs shape how politics are conducted in the contemporary world? Does violence have a role in politics? Should animals as well as humans be represented in politics? What do bodies and sexuality have to do with politics? Living political ideas is an exciting Level 3 politics and international studies course that debates these and similar questions. It demonstrates the relevance of political ideas for understanding contemporary issues in national and world politics. The award winning study materials include software, video, audio, websites and print (British Universities Film &amp; Video Council, Learning on Screen Awards 2009).</dc:description>

This will help you bring out the underlying 'living' ideas at stake, as well as the historical resonances often to be found in the political debates of the present. You'll also build on your ability to reflect on the meaning of a piece of text and analyse it, whether it is a political theory extract, a newspaper article, or a work memo.</learningOutcome>

			<mlo:prerequisite>The course is for you if you want to specialise in psychology or have a wider interest in the social sciences. Although it has applications to real situations, it does not offer prescriptions for behaviour; rather, it tries to give a wider appreciation of the complexities and limits, as well as the uses, of psychology. This is a challenging and demanding Level 3 course. Level 3 courses build on study skills and subject knowledge acquired from studies at Levels 1 and 2. They are intended only for students who have recent experience of higher education in a related subject, preferably with the OU. You should be able to write clear and well-structured essays in a conventional academic style; compare and assess different theoretical approaches; give accurate references and bibliographies; handle quantitative and qualitative evidence; understand abstract (social science) concepts, themes and models; and relate theory to practice. You are strongly advised to take an introductory psychology course before this one, in particular Exploring psychology (DSE212). (Your regional or national centre will be able to tell you where you can see reference copies of this course.) This course has strong links with Exploring psychology (DSE212) and complements the subject matter of both Child development (ED209) and Cognitive psychology (DD303).

			<dc:description xsi:type="xcriTerms:careerOutcome">Making social worlds has relevance to a wide range of employment situations including public administration, health and social services, education, business, and other private and public sector organisations. It offers students the opportunity to develop transferable skills, such as the ability to gather, analyse and present written information to audiences, present reasoned arguments, and write reports, and it will help you plan and design your own work.</dc:description>
			<dc:description>In order to survive, human beings live in social worlds which create security, foster stable attachment between individuals and things, and regulate behaviour. This accessible, vocationally relevant course demonstrates how sociological approaches can be applied to make sense of these processes - investigating how they work and how they sometimes fail. Through topics such as immigration, medicine, family, money and reality television, you will explore how social experience is shaped by nature and the material world, and made meaningful through culture and the media. The course is ideal if you have previously studied the social sciences or arts and want to consolidate your understanding of sociology.</dc:description>

			<dc:description>This course teaches economic theories that explain the behaviour of people in households, firms, markets and governments. It presents alternative economic explanations that will enable you to make your own critical judgements of which theory serves which purpose best. The course also equips you with the research skills that you'll need to conduct your own project on a topic you want to know more about. At the end of the course, you should have developed a more critical view of the socio-economic world in which you live.</dc:description>

			<dc:description>Drawing on a wide range of studies and some classic pieces of psychological research, this key introductory Level 1 course provides an accessible and engaging introduction to the study of psychology. Discovering psychology explores the different ways in which psychologists investigate the human mind and behaviour, and shows you how psychological research addresses real-life issues. You will be provided with a textbook and access to a website containing an online study guide, audio-visual material and interactive activities which are designed to help you develop your knowledge and skills.</dc:description>

			<mlo:assessment>You can choose whether to submit your tutor-marked assignments (TMAs) on paper or online through the eTMA system. You may want to use the eTMA system for some of your assignments but submit on paper for others. This is entirely your choice.</mlo:assessment>
			<learningOutcome>You will learn about: some of the topics that psychologists investigate how the research process develops from asking questions, through collecting evidence to evaluating the findings. You will develop skills in: accessing and interpreting information constructing arguments presenting and communicating information. You will develop the skill of managing your time effectively by organising your work to meet a schedule. You will also have the opportunity to reflect on a study pathway leading to personal and/or career goals.</learningOutcome>
			<mlo:prerequisite>This is a key introductory Level 1 course. Level 1 courses provide core subject knowledge and study skills needed for both higher education and distance learning, to help you progress to Level 2 study. If you studied a long time ago, or have not studied at a higher level at all (i.e. you do not have an A level or its equivalent), we highly recommend that you study the 30-credit Introducing the social sciences - part one (DD131) before Discovering psychology . DSE141 has been designed to be combined with DD131. If you have no prior study of social sciences and you feel that you need to build social sciences knowledge and skills, we recommend that you study the 60-credit Introducing the social sciences (DD101) before Discovering psychology . If you are interested in a more scientifically orientated approach, you can study the 30-credit science course Introducing health sciences: a case study approach (SDK125) before Discovering psychology . If your study goal is a degree in psychology, we strongly recommend that you study Discovering psychology as a Level 1 module in your degree. See BSc (Honours) Psychology for more information. If you are new or a less confident learner, start with Starting with psychology (Y183). This is an Openings course, also at Level 1 but worth 15 credits. Designed with lots of support and no examination, it will give you a gentle introduction to this subject and to OU study. If you successfully complete this Openings course, you'll be ready to study DSE141. If you have any doubt about the suitability of the course, please contact our Student Registration &amp; Enquiry Service.</mlo:prerequisite>

			<dc:description>How humans think, develop, and experience the world around us has been fascinating psychologists for over 100 years. Using a historical and biographical framework, this course introduces you to a wide range of psychological approaches, including biological, social, and cognitive psychologies. It looks at areas such as identity, learning, memory, and language. But you won't just learn about psychological theories, you'll learn how to do different types of psychological research too. You'll undertake practical work using quantitative and qualitative research methods and learn to analyse data using statistical software. All in all, Exploring psychology will give you a thorough overview of psychology, relevant to your daily life.</dc:description>

Alternatively, if you feel you would benefit from a greater degree of preparation, study the 60-credit Introducing the social sciences (DD101) and Discovering psychology (DSE141). You are expected to have some basic knowledge of how to use a computer, so that you can for instance use the mouse or keyboard to open a document or program, navigate around a standard screen and windows on a PC, print a document and use a word processor. Guidance is provided on installing software. If you have any doubt about the suitability of the course, please contact our Student Registration &amp; Enquiry Service.</mlo:prerequisite>

			<mlo:assessment>You must use the online eTMA system to submit your tutor-marked assignment (TMA) and end-of-module assessment (EMA). For the TMA you'll produce short answers on a series of short scenarios, in preparation for a more substantial report in the EMA. Assessment is an essential part of the teaching, so you are expected to complete it all. You will be given more detailed information when you begin the course.</mlo:assessment>
			<mlo:prerequisite>As this is a Level 2 course, a certain level of study skills is required, such as the ability to follow an argument; to relate information from tables and graphs to text discussions; and to formulate a reasoned case in discussion and written work. You're expected to have basic knowledge of how to use a computer, so that you can, for instance, use the mouse or keyboard to open a document or program, navigate around a standard screen and windows on a PC, browse the internet, print a document and use a word processor. Although it is not a requirement, you may find it very useful to have studied Exploring psychology (DSE212) before studying this course. (We recommend you study DSE232 in September after you have completed DSE212 - you should not study both at the same time). If you have any doubt about the suitability of the course, please contact our Student Registration &amp; Enquiry Service.</mlo:prerequisite>

			<dc:description xsi:type="xcriTerms:careerOutcome">This course provides a sophisticated understanding of the processes and players that shape the contemporary international system, and a knowledge of key aspects of international affairs. It offers an interdisciplinary view of the international order, drawing widely from the social sciences. As such, it is an invaluable guide to those interested in making sense of contemporary international developments and wishing to analyse and evaluate questions of public policy and action in this increasingly important sphere. This makes the course especially valuable if you work in any organisation, public or private, that operates internationally or seeks to influence public policy and debate on international matters.</dc:description>
			<dc:description>How can we best understand and analyse international developments such as the role of the World Trade Organisation, the power of the USA, the rise of China and India, or contests over religion, culture and rights? What are the main features of international order, how are they changing, and what can we expect in the future? This interdisciplinary course provides the tools of political and economic analysis needed to answer such questions. You will also review and debate the power politics of dominant states; struggles for rights and justice; economic and technological developments; and how world order is changing.</dc:description>

			<dc:description xsi:type="xcriTerms:careerOutcome">This course provides a sophisticated understanding of the processes and players that shape contemporary international environmental problems. It offers an interdisciplinary view of these, and the policy responses and debates that have arisen, drawing widely from the social sciences. As such, it is an invaluable guide to those interested in making sense of contemporary international environmental problems and wishing to analyse and evaluate questions of public policy and action in this increasingly important sphere. This makes the course especially valuable if you work in any organisation, public or private, that operates in the environmental field, particularly those with an international orientation, or which seeks to influence public policy and debate on international environmental matters. The study of DU311 will equip you with a range of transferable skills, including how to conduct independent research and evaluate diverse sources, which are sought after in a number of areas including environmental management and policy, and planning. Are you are interested in geography? This module will broaden your outlook. If you are also interested in going on to further study for a PGCE you will find our booklet Becoming a teacher useful.</dc:description>
			<dc:description>This innovative course explores the causes and consequences of a range of international environmental problems and resource conflicts, including loss of biological diversity, water allocation and urbanisation. Particular attention is paid to climate change. You'll learn how political divisions, inequalities and contentions over values and knowledge can hinder policy responses to environmental problems, and evaluate what can and should be done in the future at both political and individual levels. The course is ideal if you wish to develop a policy-relevant understanding of international environmental problems for either personal interest or career development.</dc:description>

			<dc:description>This short course, with a week-long residential school at its core, provides an opportunity to develop your practical skills in psychological research. It builds on the associated course Exploring psychology (DSE212), using materials from this course - alongside other resources - to help you prepare for the residential school. During the residential week, you will engage in activities that demonstrate the practical and ethical issues involved in conducting research. You'll also design, conduct and analyse one project as part of a group, using either quantitative or qualitative methods. Register early if you have a preferred date and venue in mind as unfortunately we can't always offer your first choice.</dc:description>

In order to claim this qualification you must have completed the required 120 credits by this time (including the 60 credits from the Postgraduate Certificate in Information Systems (C51)). This qualification is not available to new students. If you have any questions about your eligibility for this qualification please contact the Qualifications and Ceremonies Centre on +44 (0)1908 653003 or by email . This postgraduate diploma course provides you with the means to build a broader conceptualisation of information systems and to challenge existing assumptions. It will give you both a robust conceptual framework and an effective 'toolkit' of techniques and skills to help you think creatively about problems and possibilities.

Effective integration of business with technology is critically important and this qualification helps you develop this perspective and implement it in practice.</dc:description>

			<dc:description xsi:type="xcriTerms:careerOutcome">This course is for practitioners working with young children and their families in a wide range of early years settings across the UK, and its content is directly relevant to practice. The course is the first module of the Foundation Degree in Early Years or the Diploma of Higher Education in Childhood Practice and will meet the needs of adults seeking to become highly qualified and experienced early years practitioners, including those who aspire to achieve the graduate Early Years Professional Status (EYPS) in England. If you are an experienced practitioner there is an accreditation of prior experiential learning (APEL) route The early years:developing practice (APEL route) (EZL100) that enables you to demonstrate core subject knowledge and study skills needed for both higher education and distance learning to help you to progress to courses at Level 2 (SCQF Levels 8 and 9).</dc:description>

			<mlo:assessment>You can choose whether to submit your tutor-marked assignments (TMAs) on paper or online through the eTMA system. You may want to use the eTMA system for some of your assignments but submit on paper for others. This is entirely your choice. The end-of-module assessment (EMA) is a project.</mlo:assessment>
			<mlo:prerequisite>This is a key introductory Level 1 course. Level 1 courses provide core subject knowledge and study skills needed for both higher education and distance learning to help you to progress to courses at Level 2. This course is available in the UK and to students working in English-medium, early years settings which teach a UK or Republic of Ireland curriculum (e.g. Early Years Foundation Stage) in Europe and British Forces schools. You must have been working with young children aged from birth to seven years in an early years setting prior to starting the course for six months if full time or 12 months if part time for at least five hours per week. You may have been working in a paid or a voluntary capacity. During the course, you will need to be working in the setting for a minimum of five hours a week in order to carry out the practical activities. As this leads to a professional qualification recognised by the Children's Workforce Development Council (CWDC), you must be over the age of eighteen years at course start date. To work in an early years setting you will need to meet the 'fit person' criteria for doing so, including obtaining the necessary criminal record clearance required for the setting and country in which you are working. It is the responsibility of you and your employer to ensure you meet these requirements, and not the OU. You should contact the relevant agency in your country for more information if you are in doubt about your eligibility, or to find out more. For who to contact in England, Ireland, Scotland or Wales, see the Childhood and Youth website under the heading Criminal Record Clearance . If you are new or a less confident learner, start with Understanding children and young people (Y176). This is an Openings course, also at Level 1 but worth 15 credits. Designed with lots of support and no examination, it will give you a gentle introduction to this subject and to OU study. If you successfully complete this Openings course, you'll be ready to study E100 providing you meet the entry requirements above. If you have any doubt about the suitability of the course, please contact our Student Registration &amp; Enquiry Service.</mlo:prerequisite>

			<mlo:prerequisite>This is a key introductory Level 1 course. Level 1 courses provide core subject knowledge and study skills needed for both higher education and distance learning to help you progress to courses at Level 2. As this leads to a professionally recognised qualification, you must be over the age of eighteen years at course start date. Prior to beginning the course, it is desirable that you gain some experience of supporting primary-aged children (aged 4-11 in England, Wales and Northern Ireland and aged 4-12 in Scotland) with their school learning. You also need to have some knowledge of how schools for primary-aged children work. Whilst studying the course you must be based in, or have weekly access to, a primary school or closely related setting, either as an employed teaching assistant or a volunteer helper working alongside teachers and supporting children's learning in classrooms. This should be the equivalent of at least five hours per week. If you are in a nursery setting then you must work with children who are aged four years or above for this required minimum time during the week. You must have the agreement and support of your head teacher before embarking on this course as you will need to access school policies, be able to observe children, and have some involvement in planning activities for children with a teacher. It is important to make sure you will be able to do these things - especially if you are a volunteer. If you have any doubt about the level of study, or the necessary access to a school, please contact our Student Registration &amp; Enquiry Service and see the E111 Frequently asked questions on the Childhood and Youth studies website . To work in a primary school or related setting you will need to meet the 'fit person' criteria for doing so, including obtaining the necessary criminal record clearance required for the setting and country in which you are working. It is the responsibility of you and your employer to ensure you meet these requirements, and not The Open University's. You should contact the relevant agency in your country for more information if you are in doubt about your eligibility, or to find out more. For who to contact in England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales visit the Childhood and Youth Studies website . If you are new or a less confident learner, start with Understanding children and young people (Y176). This is an Openings course, also at Level 1 but worth 15 credits. Designed with lots of support and no examination, it will give you a gentle introduction to this subject and to OU study. If you successfully complete this Openings course, you'll be ready to study E111 providing you meet the entry requirements above. If you have any doubt about the suitability of the course, please contact our Student Registration &amp; Enquiry Service.</mlo:prerequisite>

			<dc:description xsi:type="xcriTerms:careerOutcome">This course is aimed at people working in sport and fitness wanting to develop their skills and/or career in the subject area. It forms fifty per cent of the Certificate of Higher Education in Sport, Fitness and Management, and twenty-five per cent of the Foundation Degree in Sport and Fitness. The course is suitable for those working in appropriate settings throughout the UK. Students in Scotland may wish to consider linking to the Diploma of Higher Education in Sport and Fitness. After using work-based learning on this course the general insights to the sector and greater self-awareness and communication skills will make you more employable. Other instructional qualifications may be needed for those wishing to instruct or coach professionally such as those required in the Level 2 work-based modules of the foundation degree: Science and theory into practice: sports coaching (EXC223) and Science and theory into practice: exercise instruction (EXF223).</dc:description>
			<dc:description>This work-based learning module will help you apply ideas from your study to work, ideally in a sport or fitness environment. It will improve your effectiveness and awareness of professional issues at work. It is aimed at health and fitness instructors, sports coaches, junior leisure centre managers and those supporting in voluntary sports clubs. You will develop reflective skills and a sound understanding of the key principles and values underlying leading and motivating people.

			<dc:description xsi:type="xcriTerms:careerOutcome">The course is a compulsory module in our Certificate in Working with Young People, Foundation Degree and Diploma of Higher Education in Working with Young People, and BA (Honours) Youth Work. This course is for you if you are a practitioner currently working with young people to support their informal learning. The course defines 'work with young people' as professional interventions where participation is voluntary and the aims are to do with informal education. Such work can be within a voluntary or a statutory setting, but students must be attached to a suitable organisation (see Entry below). For example, you might be involved in: running a youth club outreach work with young people in a housing estate a faith-based group that works with young people on personal development advising young people on health or careers supporting the informal learning of young people be that outside or within a formal education setting such as a school or college working with a group of scouts or guides.</dc:description>
			<dc:description>This course develops the practical and analytical skills needed to work directly with young people - individually and in groups - and in particular the quality of the relationships you build with them. The course draws on knowledge developed in Introduction to working with young people (E131) - so we strongly recommend that you complete E131 first. You'll also need to be able to undertake work-based learning, and be working with young people aged 13- 19 in a suitable setting for at least five hours a week.</dc:description>

			<mlo:assessment>You must submit your tutor-marked assignments (TMAs) on paper. The first assignment requires you to complete a work-based learning support form, confirming that you have identified a suitable confirmer, observer, and professional supervisor to support you in your work-based studies. You will need to pass this assignment in order to proceed to the rest of the course. As part of your assignments, you will need to have one observation of your face-to-face work with a young person/people. If unsuccessful at the first attempt, there are two further opportunities to complete an observation. It is a requirement that, by the end of the course, you must have successfully passed an observation of your practice. It is also a requirement that you attend either a face-to-face day school or take part in the online Alternative Learning Experience instead. You will not be able to pass the course without satisfying this requirement. As part of your assignments, you will also be required to identify evidence from your practice to back up your reflections on your practice. You will be shown how to use evidence effectively and efficiently, avoiding excessive evidence gathering.</mlo:assessment>
			<learningOutcome>You'll use examples from your own practical work with young people, and plan and undertake new (small-scale) work. You will be required to think about examples of past and current work, and you'll be introduced to the processes involved in becoming a reflective practitioner. You'll also learn how to evaluate your own practice, and present evidence of your professional competence for assessment. You'll learn how to use online forums to support your own learning. You'll also attend a compulsory face-to-face Day School which provides an opportunity for experiential learning on the topic of group work. There will be an Alternative Learning Experience (ALE) for those who are unable to attend, perhaps because of mobility problems, or geographical location. This alternative takes place online using online communication. Students who fail to attend either the Day School or to take part in the ALE will not be able to pass the course.</learningOutcome>
			<mlo:prerequisite>You are strongly advised to study the course Introduction to working with young people (E131) prior to starting on E118. The E118 materials refer back to aspects of the E131 materials. At the beginning of the course you will need to demonstrate that you have already gained six months experience of working with young people to support their informal learning. This must be six months working with young people, aged 13-19, for one session two to three times per week or the equivalent in an informal education setting during the last three years. You must also be currently working with young people to support their informal learning and it is your current and future work that you will use in E118. As this leads to a professionally recognised qualification, you must be over the age of eighteen years at course start date and you will need to: be working within an organisation in a suitable setting have support from your employer for your participation in the course (see 'Support from your workplace' below) have successfully passed through recruitment and induction processes within your organisation meet the course 'fit person' criteria for working with young people, including having an up-to-date criminal records disclosure appropriate for the setting and country in which you are working have access to, or be able to obtain access to, the types of work required by the course. This work must enable you to develop relationships with young people; support groups of young people; and develop community engagement with young people secure a person, or persons to take on the roles of: confirming that your evidence is authentic; observing your practice on one occasion; and providing supportive professional supervision. Your observer/supervisor should be professionally qualified (JNC or equivalent) and must have at least two years' post-qualifying experience. Your face-to-face work with young people must be for at least five hours per week. You also need an additional three hours per week planning and evaluating your work with young people. If you do not have the same contact time each week, this figure can be treated as an average. However, the contact must be on a regular rather than a sporadic basis i.e. 135 hours over the duration of the course, but a minimum of 17 hours each month. If you have any doubt about the suitability of the course, please contact our Student Registration &amp; Enquiry Service.</mlo:prerequisite>

			<dc:description xsi:type="xcriTerms:careerOutcome">This course is aimed at practitioners working in a wide range of early years settings with young children and their families. The content has direct vocational relevance to practice.</dc:description>
			<dc:description>Please note that this course is not open for registration unless you have successfully studied E123 or the discontinued APEL course EZL123. This course (and E123) has been replaced by our new 60-credit course The early years: developing practice (E100) from October 2009. If you have successfully studied E123 and wish to study E124 (towards the Certificate in Early Years Practice, Foundation Degree in Early Years or BA and BA (Hons) Early Years) there is an opportunity to do so. E123 and E124 will be presented for the last time in October 2011. Please contact our Student Registration &amp; Enquiry Service for further advice. This course enables you to focus on your role working with young children (particularly aged 0-6 years), including those with special educational needs or with English as an additional language, and those identified as gifted or talented. You will examine policy relating to the regulation and promotion of children's status, welfare and learning; and its impact on children and adults in the home, in early years settings, and in out-of-school contexts. You'll also gain a broader understanding of the early childhood curriculum - focusing on supporting children's learning in key areas such as language, literacy and communication; mathematical development; and personal, social and emotional development.</dc:description>

			<mlo:assessment>You must submit your tutor-marked assignments (TMAs) on paper. The end-of-module assessment (EMA) is a project that takes the place of an examination. Equal weighting is given to the TMAs and the EMA and you must pass both parts to pass the course. Assessment is an essential part of the teaching and so you are required to complete it all. You will be given more detailed information when you begin the course.</mlo:assessment>
			<mlo:prerequisite>This course is available in the United Kingdom and to students working in English-medium early years settings in Europe and British Forces schools who have already studied and passed E123 or the discontinued APEL course EZL123. You must have been working with young children, in either a paid or a voluntary capacity, in an early years setting prior to starting the course for six months if full time, and a year if part time. During the course, you will need to be working in the setting for a minimum of five hours a week in order to carry out the practical activities. To work in an early years setting you will need to meet the 'fit person' criteria for doing so, including obtaining the necessary criminal record clearance required for the setting and country in which you are working. It is the responsibility of you and your employer to ensure you meet these requirements, and not the OU. You should contact the relevant agency in your country for more information if you are in doubt about your eligibility, or to find out more. For who to contact in England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales visit the Childhood and Youth Studies website . Level 1 courses provide core subject knowledge and study skills needed for both higher education and distance learning, to help you to progress to courses at Level 2. If you have any doubt about the suitability of the course, please contact our Student Registration &amp; Enquiry Service.</mlo:prerequisite>

			<dc:description xsi:type="xcriTerms:careerOutcome">Introduction to working with young people is aimed at practitioners working in a wide range of settings involving work with young people, focusing on the age range 13-19. You might, for example, be involved in: running a youth club working with young people on a housing estate participating in a church group advising young people on health or careers mentoring young people working with a group of scouts or guides.</dc:description>
			<dc:description>This Level 1 course introduces key principles and ideas underpinning work with young people - particularly aged 13-19 - in areas of practice where their participation is voluntary, and the aims relate to informal education. You will examine the origins and scope of this work; its underpinning values and purposes; the changing contexts in which it occurs; how it is implemented; roles and responsibilities of practitioners and policy makers; and the issues they face. You will develop a reflective stance towards your own practice and that of others. It would be helpful - though not essential - for you to be directly engaged in work with young people, or have recent experience in the field.</dc:description>

			<mlo:prerequisite>This is a key introductory Level 1 course. Level 1 courses provide core subject knowledge and study skills needed for both higher education and distance learning to help you to progress to courses at Level 2. Before starting this course, it is expected that you will have current or recent experience of working with young people in a setting such as those listed above. A suitable level of experience for this course might be six months of one session (two/three hours) per week, or the equivalent, during the last three years. If you do not have experience of working with young people, you will be able to complete this course, but you will not be able to progress to Leading work with young people (E132) or to the practice-based courses Introduction to working with young people in practice (E118), Leading work with young people in practice (E218) and Youth: policy in practice (E318). An APEL (Accreditation of prior experiential learning) fast track version of this course is also available - Introduction to working with young people: supported APEL route (EZL131). This is appropriate for students with substantial recent experience of working with young people, knowledge of the theoretical basis for this kind of work and a readiness for higher education study. If you are new or a less confident learner, start with Understanding children and young people (Y176). This is an Openings course, also at Level 1 but worth 15 credits. Designed with lots of support and no examination, it will give you a gentle introduction to this subject and to OU study. If you successfully complete this Openings course, you'll be ready to study E131 providing you meet the entry requirements above. If you have any doubt about the suitability of the course, please contact our Student Registration &amp; Enquiry Service.</mlo:prerequisite>

			<dc:description>This course introduces key principles and ideas concerning leadership in work with young people - particularly aged 13-19 - in areas of practice where their participation is voluntary, and the aims relate to informal education. It takes leadership to be a process of working with and through others to achieve shared objectives. It views leadership not only as linked to hierarchical position, but also as dispersed throughout the organisation, occurring at all levels - including that of the young people who are the 'clients' or 'users' of the services.</dc:description>

			<mlo:prerequisite>This is a Level 1 course. Level 1 courses provide the core subject knowledge and study skills support needed for university study at this level. They will help you to progress to courses at Level 2. Before starting the course, you must have have current or recent experience of working with young people in an informal education setting such as a youth club, Scout group, or careers advisory work, with the aim of promoting the learning and development of young people. If you have not had any such experience, you will not be able to complete the assignments. Provided that you have recent experience of working with young people (even if you are not currently working with young people), you will be able to complete this course. However, you will not be able to progress to the practice-based courses Introduction to working with young people in practice (E118), Leading work with young people in practice (E218) and Youth: policy in practice (E318), without current experience. These practice-based courses require that you have suitable employment (paid or unpaid) for a minimum number of hours in an appropriate setting. An APEL (Accreditation of Prior Experiential Learning) version of this course, Leading work with young people: supported APEL route (EZL132) is available for students with substantial recent experience of working with young people, knowledge of the theoretical basis for this kind of work and a readiness for higher education study.

The need for software development projects to be successful is increasingly important as software systems become more complex and organisations become ever more dependent on their software systems. As product life cycles get shorter and as technology enables more ways of producing goods and services, it is becoming harder to meet a client's requirements and deliver a new software system within the constraints of time, cost and quality.</dc:description>

This diploma course is for you if you wish to study core aspects of business studies for personal and career development. Initially you can choose to study one of two options. An introduction to the critical analysis of business behaviour, if you are comfortable with the broader behavioural perspectives adopted in the social sciences; or an introduction to business functions, if you have a grounding in more managerial and/or technical perspectives. The final module brings together both approaches, aiding you in the development of a critical assessment of business decision-making, strategy development, and the interaction of business and government.</dc:description>

			<learningOutcome>This qualification equips you to seize career opportunities associated with a wide variety of leadership and practice development roles in healthcare. Students studying for this qualification have typically been interested in project working, learning research design skills and exploring ways of working with colleagues to best effect while contributing to quality assurance initiatives. It provides a well balanced knowledge and skills base for practitioners who play a pivotal role in healthcare organisations and their work meeting targets or addressing other agenda requirements. At a personal level the qualification is professionally satisfying, assisting you to examine the basis of your expertise, the ways in which skills help to achieve desirable outcomes and to understand the part that evidence can and should play in today's healthcare. A significant part of our teaching is associated with increasing personal satisfaction in practice, as well as enhancing competence in higher levels of work. Research skills are considered an important part of advancing healthcare practice, so within this qualification you will pay particular attention to the conception, design and conduct of research that has significance and benefit in the practice setting. You will also give close attention to the sourcing and evaluation of evidence, from wherever it may come. Combining evidence and a deeper understanding of practice skills will enable you to work in more entrepreneurial ways. The postgraduate diploma is in tune with the Department of Health's agenda on modernising healthcare professionals' careers. The qualification is suitable for healthcare professionals from medical, nursing, midwifery, health visiting and allied health backgrounds in public and private healthcare systems, and within the community and the voluntary sector.

			<dc:description>If you're thinking about teacher training but would find a traditional full-time course difficult, the Open University's Professional Graduate Diploma in Education (PGDE) could be the answer. The PGDE is the most popular route into a career in teaching at secondary level in Scotland. Our modular PGDE in secondary mathematics - which leads to a Teaching Qualification (TQ) conferred by the General Teaching Council for Scotland (GTCS) - offers a flexible alternative to conventional university courses. You can study on a part-time or full-time basis, taking either one or two years. You'll study the theory of teaching and learning through supported open learning, which you'll apply in practice during sustained periods of teaching in two partner schools. The study materials provide a supportive context for teacher training in today's schools across the secondary age range - introducing you to the ideas and issues that underpin effective teaching and learning. In addition, online forums enable you to take part in discussions about your subject and teaching; exchange resources for classroom teaching; and debate contemporary education issues.</dc:description>

			<dc:description>Our Open Programme is one of the most flexible undergraduate programmes in the UK. This nationally recognised Diploma of Higher Education Open (Open DipHE) - the second step in the programme - allows you to choose Level 1 and 2 modules from any of our undergraduate subjects. If you're uncertain right now of where your future lies, the Open DipHE is perfect. You can keep an open mind throughout, follow your interests and maybe stretch your mind to study a module that's completely different to anything you've ever considered before. You can focus your studies in just one subject or combine modules from more than one subject - the choice is yours. This qualification, following on from the Open CertHE (K05), can be a stepping stone to an honours degree. By completing a further 120 credits at Level 3 you can gain a BA or BSc Open degree with honours or, if you choose the right combination of modules, an honours degree in a named subject.</dc:description>

			<abstract>The Open DipHE builds on the Open CertHE and allows you to choose Level 1 and 2 modules from any of our undergraduate subjects.</abstract>
			<learningOutcome>The flexibility of the Open Programme means that a range of careers and industries are open to you. Many graduates choose to enter careers that are not directly related to the subject(s) they studied and this is reflected in the fact that around 70 per cent of graduate jobs are open to graduates of any discipline. What makes Open programme students stand out is the rich view of the world they develop, the perspectives they encounter and the range of skills they develop from having studied a diverse range of subjects. Regardless of what you choose to study, the Open DipHE will let you successfully develop a range of transferable skills including: adaptability and flexibility problem solving communication and literacy numeracy information technology (IT) analysis and reporting.

			<dc:description>Is there a link between poverty and crime? Are inequality and injustice factors in anti-social behaviour? What can be done to tackle the breakdown of social cohesion that resulted in rioting and looting in Britain's inner cities? Can early childhood intervention and other crime prevention schemes provide an effective alternative to punishment through the criminal justice system? The Diploma of Higher Education in Social Policy and Criminology explores the debates that lie behind these key questions. You'll examine contemporary controversies about how to deal with the apparent rise in crime and disorder at a time of recession, rising unemployment and deepening public sector austerity; and investigate issues of crime and social policy in local, national and international contexts. This wide-ranging diploma course will equip you with concepts and theories that underpin contemporary criminology and social policy, and develop the skills you need to evaluate the range of policy alternatives.</dc:description>

			<mlo:prerequisite>To register for this course you will require a bachelors degree (or equivalent) in any discipline relevant to children and young people. Applicants without this qualification, but who have professional experience of at least three years may be eligible for consideration. You should include evidence of this experience in the supplementary information we ask you to provide when you reserve a place. The research project option in E807 is only available if you are a UK resident as you will need to have successfully obtained an Enhanced Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) clearance check (or equivalent in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland). Students in Scotland will also need to ensure that they meet the requirements of the Protection of Vulnerable Groups Scheme. Further details can be found at www.pvgschemescotland.org . The criminal record check must be appropriate for the setting in which you intend to carry out your research. The CRB (or equivalent) must bear the same name as given in your post-registration agreement form. You also need permission from your employer to undertake this work. If these conditions cannot be fulfilled then you must choose the E807 literature review option. Please note : it is a legal, rather than an Open University requirement, that you must obtain Enhanced CRB clearance in order to work with children. This is the responsibility of you and your employer and not The Open University. If you are in doubt about your eligibility, or to find out more, you should contact the relevant agency in your country for more information. The course is taught in English, and your spoken and written English must be of an adequate standard for postgraduate study. If English is not your first language, we recommend that you seek assessment under the International English Language Testing System (IELTS). Please see their website for details.</mlo:prerequisite>

			<dc:description xsi:type="xcriTerms:careerOutcome">The course can be taken as a module of the Masters in Education degree. If you are particularly interested in the English language, linguistics and teaching English, you may wish to follow the MA in Education (Applied Linguistics) line of the Masters degree (F01). Whilst designed to appeal to a broad range of educationalists interested or involved in the role of language and literacy, the course will be of particular interest to anyone teaching English to speakers of other languages (TESOL), English as an additional language (EAL), English as a foreign language (EFL) or any other aspect of English language teaching (ELT). If you are involved in English language education, a postgraduate degree in applied linguistics and language education is an excellent qualification for enhancing your career potential. Educators who would find E852 of interest include: EFL/ESOL teachers wishing to complement practical qualifications with a solid grounding in theoretical issues. (More practical qualifications would include the Cambridge Diploma in Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (Delta) and Trinity College certificates and diploma). Teachers using English as a medium for instruction in both English and non-English speaking countries who wish to support their students' English language and writing skills. Primary and secondary school teachers interested in supporting their students' language development, particularly students with English as an additional language (EAL). Teachers and lecturers in further education (FE) colleges and universities specialising in the teaching of English for academic purposes (EAP) and/or academic literacy and study skills support. E852 counts as a module of the MA in Education (Applied Linguistics)/MEd (Applied Linguistics) which is a qualification generally recognised as suitable for academic managers. If you hold a Cambridge Diploma in Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (Delta) (course entry from September 2008) or a Trinity College London Licentiate Diploma in Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (LTCL Diploma in TESOL) (course entry from March 2011), these qualifications can count as 60 credits towards our specialised masters degree in education and give you exemption from either E852 or E854.

			<dc:description>This course shows how psychological enquiry can help us to improve our understanding of the development of children and young people. It's organised in four parts: Psychological development and early childhood introduces children's early development from a psychological perspective; Children's personal and social development follows development in a social context; and Cognitive and language development in children explores the development of cognitive and linguistic understanding and the developing child as an active agent. Finally, Developmental psychology in action presents areas in which developmental psychology plays a part in education, remediation, health psychology and the legal system with children of all ages.</dc:description>

			<mlo:assessment>You will be expected to submit your tutor-marked assignments (TMAs) online through the eTMA system unless there are some difficulties which prevent you from doing so. In these circumstances, you must negotiate with your tutor to get their agreement to submit your assignment on paper. Three of the TMAs are essays, two are practical, and one is methodology focused. Assessment is an essential part of the teaching, so you are expected to complete it all. You will be given more detailed information when you begin the course.</mlo:assessment>
			<mlo:prerequisite>ED209 is a Level 2 course and certain levels of study skills are required, such as the ability to follow an argument; to relate information from tables and graphs to text discussions; and to formulate a reasoned case in discussion and written work. Although statistics are used in the course, they are fully explained in a handbook; complex computational skills are not required. You do not need to be professionally engaged in work with children in order to follow this course, and access to children is not required. Although knowledge of psychological theory is not necessary, if you intend to follow the undergraduate psychology pathway, we recommend that you study Exploring psychology (DSE212) before taking this course. If you have any doubt about the suitability of the course, please contact our Student Registration &amp; Enquiry Service.</mlo:prerequisite>

			<dc:description>ED841 is for people working with children and young people and looks at children's development and learning in cultural, educational and social contexts. It explains how theoretical and methodological frameworks contribute to understanding developmental change and how psychological research can inform educational and clinical practice. You will learn about how children actively contribute and shape their own development through meaningful interaction with others and how the study of atypical development and individual difference contributes to theory and practice. You will also carry out a small-scale, observational study and will design an extended research proposal relevant to your own professional interests.</dc:description>

			<mlo:prerequisite>This course can be studied on its own and is also an optional module in the MA in Education, MA in Childhood and Youth, MSc in Psychology or MA in Social Sciences. You must hold a bachelors degree from a UK university or other recognised degree-awarding body, or a qualification at equivalent level. You are expected to have some experience in education or an allied field, but you need not be a practising teacher. You do not need access to an educational institution, but you will need child or adult participants for the small-scale study. We have designed the course to be accessible to all students working at masters level. Knowledge of psychology is not essential, though if you have already taken child development courses that will clearly be an asset. The course is taught in English, and your spoken and written English must be of an adequate standard for postgraduate study, as you will need to read and understand original journal articles written in English. If English is not your first language, we recommend that you seek assessment under the International English Language Testing System (IELTS). Please see their website for details. If you have any doubt about the suitability of the course, please contact our Student Registration &amp; Enquiry Service.</mlo:prerequisite>

			<dc:description xsi:type="xcriTerms:careerOutcome">This course is aimed at sports coaches wanting to develop their underpinning knowledge, skills and/or career in the subject area. It is the sports coaching version of the final module in the Foundation Degree in Sport and Fitness with Sports Coaching and Diploma of Higher Education in Sport and Fitness. By using work-based learning on this course, the general insights into science and theory, the learning and qualification process in the sector and greater self-awareness and communication skills will make you more employable. The Level 2 coaching qualification is recognised as a key indicator of competence for those wishing to practise as a professional sports coach. If you intend to work in coaching you will probably be required to ensure that your qualification and other associated requirements (such as First Aid, Child Protection and Criminal Records Bureau checks) are valid and up to date for the country you intend to work in. If you are interested in exercise instruction rather than sports coaching and/or intend to submit an exercise instruction qualification (see Entry section below) you should study the exercise instruction version of this course - Science and theory into practice: exercise instruction (EXF223) - instead.</dc:description>
			<dc:description>This 90-credit course is aimed at sports coaches wanting to develop their underpinning scientific knowledge, analytical skills and/or career in this work role. You'll focus on: applying aspects of sports science, including movement analysis and core stability; training/conditioning in work roles, including some optional study choices; and the exploration of how coaches improve and learn. You will need to have gained a Level 2 UK-accredited coaching qualification within the last eight years or to obtain one in parallel with your OU studies.</dc:description>

			<mlo:assessment>You must use the online eTMA system to submit your tutor-marked assignments (TMAs). Assessment is an essential part of the teaching and so you are required to complete it all. You will be given more detailed information when you begin the course. The certificate from successful completion of an appropriate Level 2 coaching qualification (see Entry above) will need to be electronically scanned and submitted together with the end-of-module assessment (EMA) for this course.</mlo:assessment>
			<mlo:prerequisite>This is a Level 2 course and builds on the Level 1 study in the Foundation Degree in Sport and Fitness and Diploma of Higher Education in Sport and Fitness. If you are studying towards one of these qualifications we recommend that you take Introduction to sport, fitness and management (E112), Working and learning in sport and fitness (E113) and Sport and exercise psychology: a case study approach (E233) before this course. There are no requirements concerning your level of fitness to take the course and there are no activities that require any sort of exercise. However, you should note the following important entry requirement for this course. Level 2 Coaching certificate To study and complete the assessment for this course you will need to have gained a Level 2 UK-accredited coaching qualification from an established sport with a recognised National Governing Body (NGB) or equivalent within the past eight years. If you do not hold a suitable qualification prior to commencing this course, you will need to obtain one in parallel with your OU studies. The certificate - from successful completion of this qualification - demonstrates your coaching competence and will need to be electronically scanned and submitted together with the end-of-module assessment (EMA) for this OU course. The original certificate may be requested by the OU for verification purposes. Please note that you will need to budget and pay for this qualification yourself and will need to undertake any associated courses (e.g. First Aid, Child Protection etc) as well as any CRB or police check at your own expense. Failure to successfully complete your coaching qualification will delay you achieving any credit for this OU course. Further details about these sports coaching qualifications, including which sports are recognised by the OU and what to do if you live abroad, can be obtained here .

			<dc:description xsi:type="xcriTerms:careerOutcome">This APEL route is for experienced practitioners working with young children and their families in a wide range of early years settings across the UK and Europe, and its content is directly relevant to practice. The APEL route offers a fast-track entry into the Foundation Degree in Early Years or the Diploma of Higher Education in Childhood Practice and will meet the needs of adults seeking to become highly qualified and experienced early years practitioners, including those who aspire to achieve the graduate Early Years Professional Status (EYPS) in England.</dc:description>
			<dc:description>This is the assessment-only route of The early years: developing practice (E100), the first module of the Foundation Degree in Early Years (G01) and the Diploma of Higher Education in Childhood Practice (E37). It is a demanding route, involving independent study without one-to-one tutorial support. Limited advice and support will be available through an online forum that will be moderated by experienced study advisers. You should have well-established knowledge and practical competence, gained through substantial experience in relevant early years context(s). Your learning will be assessed and certified through a portfolio of evidence, a 1500-word essay and an interview.</dc:description>

			<mlo:prerequisite>This is an assessment-only route into the Foundation Degree in Early Years, or for students in Scotland, the Diploma of Higher Education in Childhood Practice . You must be registered on one of these qualifications in order to study this APEL route. It is only appropriate for very experienced early years practitioners with a minimum of three years' experience of working with young children in a supervisory capacity who meet the minimum prerequisites for the APEL route. In order to meet the pre-requisites, you must: be aged 21 years or over by the start date in order to meet the three-year criteria above have been working directly with children in the age range of birth to seven years in a supervisory capacity for a minimum of three years full-time or a minimum of five years part-time, prior to registration for this APEL route be working in the UK or Europe have current Criminal Record clearance required for the setting and country in which you are working (see details below) be working directly with children from birth to seven years for a minimum of five hours a week in an appropriate early years setting during the APEL route. It is crucial that in addition to the requisite early years experience, you also possess the necessary academic study skills at Higher Education level 1 to complete the written assessment independently and to be able to create a portfolio of evidence. Previous experience of studying with The Open University would be an advantage. In order to assist you in determining whether the APEL route is appropriate, it is essential that you accurately complete a self assessment questionnaire. This may be downloaded here . If, after its completion, you are in any doubt at all regarding your eligibility to study the APEL route, you can ask us to contact you to offer you further advice and guidance. To do this please email your details, including your name and contact number, together with a brief description of your query. Please note that this mailbox is only for eligibility guidance regarding this APEL route and not for general or registration queries. It is imperative that you are confident you meet all the criteria for APEL before embarking upon the route. To work in an early years setting, you will need to meet the 'fit person' criteria for doing so. This will include obtaining the necessary criminal record clearance required for the setting and country in which you are working. The responsibility to ensure you meet these requirements is yours and your employers, and not the OU's. If you are in doubt about your eligibility, or to find out more, you should contact the relevant agency in your country for more information.

It is no surprise therefore that mathematics postgraduates can be found throughout industry, business and commerce, in the public and private sectors. Employers value the intellectual rigour and reasoning skills that mathematics students can acquire, their familiarity with numerical and symbolic thinking and the analytic approach to problem-solving which is their hallmark. There are a variety of reasons for studying mathematics at postgraduate level. You may want a postgraduate qualification in order to distinguish yourself from an increasingly large graduate population. You may find, particularly if you are a professional programmer or work in finance, that your undergraduate mathematical knowledge is becoming insufficient for your career requirements, especially if you are hoping to specialise in one of the more mathematical areas, which are becoming more sought after by employers. The extent of opportunities is vast and mathematics postgraduates are equipped with skills and knowledge required for jobs in fields such as finance, education, engineering, science and business, as well as mathematics and mathematical science research.

			<learningOutcome>Workplaces and work roles increasingly involve media-rich and technology-enhanced forms of learning, professional practice and personal development, often summarised in the term 'elearning'. Accordingly the experience of achieving this masters degree has proved vocationally relevant across a wide range of occupations and locations, from managers in business organisations, teachers of languages, consultants, trainers and teachers at any level of the education sector. Each module in the MA in Online and Distance Education requires study using a range of tools and learning environments. Consequently you will improve your personal skills in using these tools and this makes a positive impact on your own practice. You will explore in-depth the research and practice literature in technology enhanced learning, and experience the implications of learning technology choices made across a wide range of contexts and organisations, both formal and informal. You will advance not only your skills of selection and design of technology, but also your understanding of how technologies engage learners and how they can be evaluated and developed on a continuing basis. Depending on your choice of module study, the qualification will enable you to demonstrate in addition, expertise in particular areas: Open educational resources and approaches for learning within university, college, management or other contexts, if you include Openness and innovation in elearning (H817) The development of inclusive education in relation to the accessibility of learning contexts online for all students, including the support needs of those with a disability, if you include Accessible online learning: supporting disabled students (H810). If you wish to specialise in the research and evaluation area, you can also build a foundation in terms of engagement with the research literature and research methods, which provides an excellent platform for further postgraduate study, if you include Practice-based research in educational technology (H809). The vocational relevance of the MA in Online and Distance Education goes well beyond the obvious category of teacher and trainer, and previous alumni have included librarians, media professionals, project managers, consultants, entrepreneurs, practice educators in nursing, and web developers.

This qualification is for managers aspiring to senior positions in international agencies, federal, national, regional and local government, the uniformed services, 'quangos', NGOs, voluntary organisations, and social enterprises. It will be particularly relevant if you are involved in delivering policy, leading modernisation projects, and supporting innovation. At times, the programme will involve collaboration between managers working in all three sectors (public, private, non-profit). Reflecting the extent of international influences and policy transfer, it has a strong trans-national dimension. Nevertheless, the main focus is on enhancing your capacities in your field of work - and to that end it provides additional resources for most of the main fields of public service (such as Health, Education, Criminal Justice, the Civil Service, Trans-national Public Action). It is also highly flexible: your options can be chosen from a wide list including modules relevant to such fields as international development, education, social policy or the environment. One of the compulsory modules, Current issues in public management and social enterprise (B857), is itself modular, offering further opportunities to ensure maximum relevance to the particular challenges you face.</dc:description>

			<learningOutcome>The Foundation degree in Early Years has been developed in association with employers and professional associations. It is Sector endorsed, recognised by the Children's Workforce Development Council (CWDC), and considered 'full and relevant' for the purposes of registration and regulation - which means you'll count in the qualified ratio of staff at Level 3. Scotland: the Scottish Social Services Council has included this foundation degree course in the list of approved qualifications for managers/lead practitioners in early education and care. Northern Ireland: although the degree is not a recognised qualification for classroom assistants in Northern Ireland, it would enhance their work with Key Stage 1 children. Europe: this degree is also appropriate if you are working in English-medium early years settings in Europe and British Forces schools. Further development This Foundation Degree is a step on the way to the graduate entry pathway (GEP) that leads to Early Years Professional Status (EYPS). For further information about EYP Status see the Children's Workforce Development Council website . On completing your studies, there are several options for topping up to a full BA degree - you'll need to choose your route carefully and we recommend that you discuss your choices with one of our advisers. This degree may also be helpful if you're interested in further training as an Early Years Teacher. You'll need to check with your training provider about their entry policy for ITT programmes - please note that the OU doesn't offer teacher training for this age range. For more information see our careers advisory booklet Becoming a Teacher and visit the Teaching Agency (TA) website in England; the Teach in Scotland website in Scotland; and the Teacher Training &amp; Education in Wales website .

			<learningOutcome>The Foundation Degree in Primary Teaching and Learning is relevant to teaching assistants, higher level teaching assistants and other kinds of classroom support staff. If you're seeking higher level teaching assistant (HLTA) status - in England and Wales only - it will prepare you to gather the necessary practice-related evidence to apply for this status. It may also be helpful if you are thinking about training to be an early years or primary teacher; your choice of optional module can also be used to support this goal.

This stimulating course, produced in collaboration with the British Museum, explores the tomb-chapel paintings of Nebamun, allowing you to study the individual paintings in great detail and analyse them from an art historical perspective. The course explores what we can learn from these works of art about the social life of the period, and the problems they pose for modern viewers.</dc:description>

			<dc:description>Organisations are political arenas but we needn't be frightened of that fact. The reality of organisational politics is that it is about getting things done: about getting your views and ideas across, getting them listened to and getting them implemented. After all, we are paid to have ideas. Organisational politics should be of positive benefit to the organisation rather than a negative influence. This course examines the Machiavellian myths of the 'knife in the back' and of 'shady deals', and sets about developing interpersonal skills that will help you and your organisation achieve its aims and objectives. This course will be particularly beneficial to aspiring middle and senior managers.</dc:description>

			<dc:description>The course will offer instant access to information, help and support for busy managers faced with the management task of participating in the recruitment and selection process. Selecting competent staff is something that managers are required to do all too regularly - often because they don't get it right first time. The interview is still the preferred way of selection, even if part of a wider process involving such additions as psychological testing and full assessment centres. Many managers do not have access to the latter and are left to their own devices in the interview.</dc:description>

			<dc:description>Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is not new but nowadays it seems everyone is talking about it. Organisations and businesses everywhere are urged to protect the environment, save energy, recycle, avoid waste, and use ethical trading methods. Increasingly there are requirements to make public statements about such issues. But why is this? Is it simply a transient "fashion"? And does it make a difference? This course is not aimed at those whose whole specialist brief is CSR but rather at those at all levels - in managerial positions or professional positions - who need to know enough about CSR to understand the debate and contribute to CSR policies and practices in their organisation.</dc:description>

			<dc:description>Successful organisations rely on successful teams. That is to say, successful organisations rely on collections of individual staff members who can recognise the difference between being a team members and merely being a member of a group, and those who can work together successfully. Most staff members are, in fact, members of several different teams, working with different people on different things at different times and under different constraints. In one team they might be the leader; in another, a team member. This course is aimed at developing their skills and abilities to become effective and successful team players.</dc:description>

			<dc:description>The construction industry is experiencing times of almost certainly unprecedented turmoil. The housing market slowdown and the credit crunch, combined with changing plans from central government on funding projects, increased pressure for health and safety, welfare, environment, and sustainability, together with an increasingly diverse workforce, mean that management and leadership have never been so much in demand. In this course we explore how you can develop your skills as a leader to equip you to meet these challenges head on, cope with the complexity and still deliver your projects on time.</dc:description>

			<dc:description>In any organisation many staff become involved in marketing issues with colleagues from other areas of expertise within the organisation, in day-to-day discussions, within working groups or teams, and sometimes with external partners. Non-marketing staff need to understand the basic concepts of marketing in order to contribute to these discussions. This short course is intended for managers in organisations where there is a degree of separation between functions and will explain marketing concepts and demystify marketing jargon in order to help them understand and contribute to marketing activities.</dc:description>

			<dc:description>As managers we make decisions every day. Many of these are simple and routine, but take up a great deal of our time. Others are more complex, involving strategic actions: launching a new product into a new market, investing funds or opening a new business unit. This sort of decision can carry risks, especially in a climate that is experiencing turbulent changes and great unpredictability. In this course we explore how you can reduce the time you spend on routine decision-making. This allows you to spend more time on considering the more challenging strategic decisions that you face.</dc:description>

			<dc:description>The UK has a more diverse voluntary sector than most developed countries, and a large number of people engage in voluntary activity. Many organisations now encourage their staff to act as volunteers as part of their Corporate Social Responsibility strategy. Volunteering is an important aspect of life experience, and provides many opportunities for learning. This can benefit the volunteer, the voluntary organisation and the employer. This short online course will be of interest to those who work as volunteers with children and young people in schools and colleges, introducing the ideas of the world of work and the concept of entrepreneurism - particularly with the Young Enterprise scheme.</dc:description>

However, if you want to go on to complete the Postgraduate Certificate in Clinical Leadership (K04), it is required that you hold an honours degree or equivalent. This course has been developed in conjunction with BMJ Learning. If you register for this course, they would like to contact you about further learning opportunities. If you do not want to receive information from BMJ, please mark the relevant opt-out box on your registration agreement. You can register and begin this course at any time during the life of the course. You can study at your own pace and submit your work-based activity at any date before the final submission date for the course.

If you are working towards this postgraduate qualification you have two choices. You can either complete some or all of the requisite CPD courses prior to registering for B832 or you can register for B832 and the CPD courses at the same time, following a recommended study pattern. Please be aware that the latter option will require you to commit to approximately 12 hours of study per week so you may wish to consider this when making your choice.</mlo:prerequisite>

It is a self-contained introduction to leadership behaviours and skills for clinicians, the second in a series of 13 continuing professional development (CPD) courses on various aspects of clinical leadership. Whereas the first course What is clinical leadership?

			<dc:description>This 50-hour online course is aimed at doctors, nurses or allied health professionals working within the health service at various stages in their careers. It focuses on innovation in general and health care innovation in particular to help you understand how to take forward innovations in your own service. This course is intended to be taken after earlier courses, however, if you have used some other opportunities to assess how your service currently functions and how it might be improved, this course can also be usefully studied on its own to help you take your improvement ideas forward.</dc:description>

			<abstract>This online course focuses on both general and health care innovation to help you understand how to take forward innovations in your own se</abstract>
			<learningOutcome>On completing this course you will be able to analyse how the context within which your service operates is both driving innovation and also possibly restricting it, including the relevance of service commissioning or service planning. You will be able to assess the motivations of different stakeholders in your service in terms of kinds of innovation they welcome and what they are likely to be concerned about or fear. You will also be able to identify which areas of innovation are more relevant to your service (a) for the coming six to 12 months (b) over the next five years. You will assess which approaches to the process of innovating are likely to be successful given the concerns of stakeholders within your services and the resources available to it. This will enable you to identify the kind of role you might take up in the process of innovation over the coming months, and the implications for how you will need to develop your personal competencies.</learningOutcome>

			<learningOutcome>On completing this course you will be able to analyse the main boundaries or divisions that currently exist within the system of care which your service or specialism forms a part of. You will be able to identify where initiatives to improve the service through cross-boundary collaboration are currently underway, and where overall service performance could be improved though further collaboration across professional and/or organisational boundaries. You will also evaluate the relevance of different mechanisms for cross boundary working to these opportunities. You will analyse the relevance of NHS policies and local conditions to supporting or impeding cross boundary working relevant to your service. In addition you will be able to explain typical barriers and dilemmas that make collaboration across boundaries and explore how these may affect progress with cross boundary initiatives in your service. You will also identify and justify some initial steps for expanding cross-boundary working relevant to your service and explain how these can contribute to the longer-term development of integrated care.</learningOutcome>

			<dc:description>This course explores understandings of effective learning environments, both physical and virtual, and looks at the potential benefits of using a Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) in a school setting. You'll consider tools or functions commonly found within a school or Local Authority VLE, explore how pupil activities employ these tools, consider their relevance and value, and use them to devise activities to support your own teaching. You'll finish by assessing the effectiveness of these activities in terms of pupil learning and teacher workload. This course is aimed at practitioners across primary and secondary phases, and is delivered through The Open University's own VLE.</dc:description>

			<dc:description>Schools collect a plethora of data on their pupils, but how can we use this effectively to support teaching and learning? What are the differences between assorted sets of data? This course explores these issues, looking at the range of data available to schoolteachers (mainly in England), and how it is derived and used. It also introduces key statistical measures used in data analysis. You'll apply the principles and ideas to data for your own pupils - exploring activities like pupil target setting and pupil mentoring. You'll be encouraged throughout to share your ideas and experiences with other students and colleagues.</dc:description>

			<dc:description>Whatever your line of work, regardless of your role or the product or service your organisation provides, you'll be communicating with other people for much of the time. It follows that where interpersonal communication is poor or inadequate, the quality of work will suffer. On the other hand, ensuring 'good' and 'effective' communication is a fundamental component of providing high quality services and products - it's not a luxury or an optional extra, but essential for success. This course is for those seeking to improve skills in communicating with work colleagues, customers, service users and external stakeholders.</dc:description>

			<dc:description>Personalisation is a government-led national policy to ensure that everyone who uses support should have the choice and control to shape their lives and the services they receive. Across the UK, personalisation is also described as self-directed care or citizen-directed support.

The course is intended to be studied by all sorts of people; service users, carers, people who are employed as either health care or social care assistants - groups that might termed 'paraprofessionals' and also qualified professionals like nurses, social workers and general medical practitioners (GPs).</dc:description>

			<dc:description>Do you have to plan and manage small but tricky projects? This course is based on a toolkit, derived from working with the public and private sectors in the UK, specifically intended to help managers manage - rather than use over-proceduralised project approaches or just 'muddling along'. The jargon-free course takes you step-by-step from project outline through project proposal to monitoring and evaluating the project when it's running. Logical Frameworks, the tried and tested method applied has a successful track record. The approach includes user friendly risk analysis, stakeholder analysis, problem description and project measurement at impact level.</dc:description>

			<learningOutcome>Participants will learn to use project scoping and Logical Framework Analysis in an area of their own selection, allowing them to map out a short-hand overview of the key components of the project in a concise and open manner. When completed, participants will be able to: engage collaboratively in problem- and opportunity-identification think around problem contexts identify alternatives to a given course of action analyse risks and potential threats prepare activity plans relate the chosen activity to the context as first understood engage in opportunity planning plan and monitor activity for complex problem contexts develop contingency plans for change contexts implement activity plans monitor and evaluate project outcomes in terms of performance, impact, sustainability and strategic delivery. Further, the course will provide participants with a hands-on understanding and appreciation of systems concepts and will act as an introduction to other potentially useful tools and techniques.

			<dc:description xsi:type="xcriTerms:careerOutcome">In many countries, the expectation that disabled people will have equitable access to post-compulsory education has resulted in a wealth of information about good practice, legislation, web accessibility standards and guidelines. This course provides an opportunity for a systematic exploration of the field and will be a valuable addition to the portfolio of any online education professional, whether your role is primarily in teaching, support, learning design, technical delivery or management. It will also be of value to demonstrate your positive commitment to inclusive education and will provide a good foundation; if you are responsible for improving inclusion in your own educational context.</dc:description>
			<dc:description>This online course is concerned with improving access to learning for disabled students. There are increasing expectations in many countries that disabled students should be able to participate fully in post-16 education. This means that people responsible for provision in academic and support roles need to be aware of the impact of this on how courses are designed and delivered online. The course looks at the experiences of disabled students, the technical aspects of accessibility, and current debates and discussions about disability and accessibility in educational contexts. This course benefited from JISC TechDis expertise and materials in its production.</dc:description>

			<dc:description>The Open University's unique Open Programme is one of the most flexible undergraduate programmes in the UK. This nationally recognised Certificate of Higher Education Open (Open CertHE) - the first step of the programme - allows you to choose Level 1 modules from any of our undergraduate subjects. If you're uncertain right now of where your future lies, the Open CertHE is perfect. You can keep an open mind throughout, follow your interests and maybe stretch your mind to study a module that's completely different from anything you've ever considered before. You can focus your studies in just one subject or combine modules from more than one subject - the choice is yours. With an Open CertHE you will learn important study skills, get a thorough grounding in your chosen subject(s) and become a confident distance learner, while completing study equivalent to the first year of a full-time degree.</dc:description>

			<abstract>The Open CertHE is the first step of the Open Programme and allows you to choose Level 1 modules from any of our undergraduate subjects</abstract>
			<learningOutcome>The flexibility of the Open Programme means that a range of careers and industries are open to you. Many graduates choose to enter careers that are not directly related to the subject(s) they studied and this is reflected in the fact that around 70 per cent of graduate jobs are open to graduates of any discipline. What makes Open programme students stand out is the rich view of the world they develop, the perspectives they encounter and the range of skills they develop from having studied a diverse range of subjects. Regardless of what you choose to study, the Open CertHE will let you successfully develop a range of transferable skills including: adaptability and flexibility problem solving communication and literacy numeracy information technology (IT).

Computing and IT skills are essential in today's workplace. The economy, government, business, commerce, public services such as health and education are all critically dependent on computing and IT systems. However, it is not only in the workplace that we are affected by these rapidly developing technologies. This certificate course aims to provide a complete introduction to aspects of IT and computing technologies that affect every one of us. My digital life (TU100) isn't just about where computers have been - or even where they are now - it also tells you about where computers are taking us. All around the world, scientists and engineers are designing 'ubiquitous computers' - ones that will be quite literally everywhere; in our homes, our offices and cars, and in the products we use. You'll get hands-on experience of designing, building and programming these small, ubiquitous computers that will become increasingly common over the next decade, as well as a firm foundation for future studies.</dc:description>

			<dc:description xsi:type="xcriTerms:careerOutcome">If you pass the course you will be eligible for the Certificate in Health and Social Care, which is widely recognised by employers. Depending on your location and job role, you may be interested in one of our new Level 3 vocational diplomas. You will be able to gather evidence for your diploma alongside your K101 academic studies. This level of qualification is regarded as the 'gold standard' for carer competence. The programme enables you to reap a second harvest from the work you've done for K101 by providing much of the evidence required for your vocational diploma. There will be an additional cost for the diploma. To register for the diploma you must have successfully completed or be registered for K101 and you must be working in the sector, either in a paid or voluntarily capacity. For further information about these diplomas visit our website or email and include K101 in your message header. Please note that Vocational Qualifications are not always recognised in nations outside of the UK.</dc:description>

Learning languages opens doors to other cultures and gives you an experience of the world that goes deeper than the average tourist trip. You may also find that it offers a key to the global workplace. Our Certificate in Italian gives you the opportunity to learn to read, write and speak Italian and understand other speakers of the language, and provides an introduction to Italian culture. It is delivered by a mixture of face-to-face and online tuition so -as well as learning the language - you will also acquire good study skills and language-learning strategies for future study. In addition, you will gain valuable transferable skills in managing and motivating yourself, setting and achieving goals, working with others and using ICT, which are all highly valued by employers.</dc:description>

			<learningOutcome>As a linguist, the world is your oyster. You might be aiming for specialist career opportunities in languages such as teaching; translating; the media (publishing, journalism, advertising); leisure; tourism and travel; diplomacy; and working in international organisations. But employers in most fields, such as manufacturing, retail, financial services or the creative industries consider language skills to be essential for their competitiveness in the global economy. Speaking a foreign language, such as Italian, opens the door to a wide range of economic, social and personal benefits. In this increasingly globalised economy, UK businesses can no longer afford to rely on English as being the international lingua franca. Being able to communicate effectively with our customers, colleagues and business partners is critical to competitiveness and social cohesion.

			<dc:description xsi:type="xcriTerms:careerOutcome">This course has been designed for people in health and social care working in frontline, administrative and leadership positions. However, you do not have to work in health and social care to take this course as it recognises the interests of those who are not in paid positions hoping to enter the sector or are working in voluntary roles, providing care to friends and families or using services. Building your career in health and social care is addressed by content that draws from current policy imperatives and reflects the Level 4 National Occupational Standards, the core elements of the Knowledge and Skills Framework, and ICT skill benchmark statements from health and social care.</dc:description>
			<dc:description>Health and social care is everyone's business. Whether using a service or being cared for by family or friends, we want skilled and understanding people who can work in partnership with us to meet our needs. Using online activities to explore real-life case material with up-to-date research, policy and practice you'll learn about how adult health and social care is organised, delivered, and experienced across a range of sectors. Whether you're involved in paid or unpaid work, use health and social care services yourself, or simply have a general interest, this course is designed to deepen your understanding and develop your practice.</dc:description>

			<dc:description>Why are the issues surrounding complementary and alternative approaches to health so controversial? This course will appeal to professionals and practitioners from all areas of health and social care, and to anyone with a personal interest. It will equip you with the information and analytical frameworks to debate current key questions: what do people want from health services? how can complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) be integrated into mainstream provision, and are there benefits in doing so? how do factors like knowledge, training and regulation relate to safety and standards of CAM? is there any evidence of CAM's effectiveness?</dc:description>

			<dc:description>This is an exciting and revolutionary course in which you'll engage with real issues based on the experiences of dying people, bereaved people, those who work with them, and their carers, both lay and professional. This course will be of interest for anyone who works with dying people and their families or students who want to find out more about death, dying and bereavement, and what these mean in different contexts.</dc:description>

If you have any doubt about the suitability of the course, please contact our Student Registration &amp; Enquiry Service. On a more personal level, the course authors and tutors are greatly concerned to support students in sensitive aspects of the subject of death and dying, but please remember that your tutor is not there to help you with bereavement. The course cannot fulfil that function, though we hope that this will not deter dying or bereaved people from taking the course.</mlo:prerequisite>

			<dc:description>Ideas about the concept of mental health are hotly contested, and often personally and intellectually challenging. This course invites you to think differently about life's dilemmas by considering the views of all concerned, especially people experiencing mental distress. Using a holistic framework, it explores ideas and practice in mental health - encouraging you to review your own beliefs and experiences and to challenge yourself and others on a more informed footing. The course will appeal to a wide range of people - workers in health and social care, service users/survivors, friends and families, and anyone with a general interest in this complex and challenging topic.</dc:description>

			<dc:description>What do we mean by good communication? Does improving communication mean learning new skills, or changing the nature of the relationship between service providers and service users? Improving the quality of communication is now a key priority for health and social care: staff at all levels are expected to work in partnership with other agencies, and service users expect and demand greater equality in service provision. This course looks at communication in interpersonal, institutional and social contexts. You'll also have opportunities to reflect on your own experiences and, by working with fellow students, analyse real-life examples and explore how practice can be improved.</dc:description>

			<dc:description xsi:type="xcriTerms:careerOutcome">This course is mapped against the UK Public Health Register (UKPHR) revised standards for public health practitioners, who may come from many backgrounds but who now work in some area of public health. The UKPHR standards have been developed to create a regulatory framework for public health practitioners who are currently unregistered. Successful completion of K311 will enable you to meet most of the requirements of the standards (see the UKPHR website ). Further details will be found on the website when you start the course. For registered nurses, K311 forms 50 per cent of the study required for the public health pathway to the BSc (Hons) Nursing Practice. The remaining 50 per cent of study required is Exploring practice (K316), that enables you to use your learning from K311 to carry out a practice-related public health project. The course is mapped against the Nursing and Midwifery Council's (NMC) standards of proficiency for entry to specialist community public health nursing.</dc:description>
			<dc:description>Public health is everyone's business - not just the business of the health sector. The contribution of local authorities, education, social care, families, police, prisons, business and voluntary sectors is now acknowledged as vital. This course enables you, whatever your background and expertise, to develop your knowledge, skills and understanding of multidisciplinary public health across the UK and internationally. You'll investigate health projects, experience team working and build your skills in communication, critical reflection community involvement, policy making, and delivering ethical evidence-based practice.

			<dc:description xsi:type="xcriTerms:careerOutcome">This course is the third and final practice module in the social work degree programme.</dc:description>
			<dc:description>This course will support you as a student social worker in becoming a confident, critical, analytical and reflective practitioner, and an independent learner. It guides you towards sources of information to interrogate and evaluate. It identifies what critical reflection is and supports its application across a range of knowledge and practices. You will reflect on practice - looking at historical and international exemplars - and develop research literacy; exploring how research can inform practice and be used by practitioners. You will also examine the nature of organisations supplying social work services, how they are changing and what this means for social work practice and practitioners.</dc:description>

			<dc:description xsi:type="xcriTerms:careerOutcome">Some of your reasons to study this course may be linked to enhancing your employment prospects, or you may simply be curious to expand and develop your knowledge and understanding of the adults with whom you have some supporting or caring role; or you may be receiving support services yourself. Whatever your background and motivation, this course is designed to widen your horizons and to deepen and sharpen your facility to think holistically about the issues, structures, and the forces that create and shape adult lives and may lead to people needing additional support. This course will help you consider critically how problems may be addressed and how services may best be provided and sustained, individually, in groups, and through formal organisations.</dc:description>
			<dc:description>In the twenty-first century many more adults will live for longer than in previous generations. The emergence of an ageing society can be celebrated, but it also poses many challenges. As workers, carers, or as people receiving health or social care support, this course will enable you to explore diverse individual, environmental, policy, and practice perspectives for adults and for adulthood. It will focus on later life, mental health, long-term conditions, learning disability, and drug and alcohol use. The course incorporates a rich blend of multi-media learning resources, including stimulating case material and opportunities for online collaborative learning.</dc:description>

			<learningOutcome>Your learning will take place principally through the online learning guide via the website. This is a structured and guided online teaching environment where you engage with academic readings, websites, journal articles, video and audio clips, and a range of other learning elements that constitute the combined teaching materials for the course. The student learning activities in this context encourage you to rehearse and to develop your own lines of enquiry as a Level 3 student. Alongside this there is online communication with other students studying the course and with your tutor. On a regular basis you can share and discuss your experiences and ideas about the material you are studying. The video and audio materials are integrated into the online learning guide. These are also supplied to you on separate DVDs for offline use if required. You will receive as part of the set of study materials: a course guide; a course text book; and a range of academic articles in the field of ageing and the adult life course, to stimulate and support your learning as online resources. You learn how to evaluate and communicate many of the important issues in adult health and social care. You will also develop your facility to appreciate some of the contested areas where there may be significant differences of view about the causes and solutions to problems, or about the allocation of resources. This learning will take place in the context of developing your knowledge and your critical understanding of adulthood and ageing, and of how this enhanced facility can make a significant and positive difference to your role as a carer, a service user, or to your role as a professional. You will be encouraged to reflect upon your own learning and how this may be applied positively in practical ways, exploring, developing, and at times perhaps being encouraged to challenge your own values, assumptions, and beliefs. The course includes a wealth of material in relation to many of the commonly occurring categorisations and groupings within modern health and social care; such as: older people; mental health and wellbeing; long term conditions across the range of adult ability and disability; drug and alcohol use; and offending behaviour. These groupings, however, are not dealt with in fixed divisions but rather they are drawn upon throughout as illustrative and tangible examples in the process of learning about adulthood and ageing through the life course. The course also incorporates many of the perspectives and 'voices' of people working in practice and of people who as adults are receiving support themselves, or have a role in supporting others. These voices are included as text items, and as video and audio clips, where people comment on particular ideas illustrating issues from their personal or their professional experience. These diverse perspectives bring an immediacy and variety to the study process as you learn to engage with and evaluate directly the opinions and the contexts of a rich variety of adults, their supporters, carers, and professionals. As students, you also join in this collaborative process by learning and sharing with your fellow students studying the course.</learningOutcome>

You must have successfully completed a Diploma of Higher Education (Nursing) or equivalent and also be registered with the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC). You will normally need to be working in an appropriate field of practice. If you are a new student intending to count this course towards the degree in nursing practice it may not be an appropriate starting point for your studies. Please contact your national or regional centre for advice about this and to ensure that you have a practicable study plan for this qualification.

			<dc:description>This course explores how nurses develop critical knowledge and understanding of the impact policy decisions have made on everyday nursing practice. It enables you to make links between policy and practice; question how policy is made and for whose benefit. By critically analysing policy decisions and their influences, you will be putting patients and the public first within a local, national and international context. The course will assist you in enhancing your strategic thinking skills in relation to policy and what drives policy change. On successful completion of this course, nurses will feel more empowered to contribute to the policy making process, its effective implementation and ongoing evaluation.</dc:description>

			<dc:description>Leading healthcare improvements will assist you to investigate change in your local practice setting and to develop your leadership skills in relation to policy, innovation and service improvement. This is achieved by studying concepts taught through the study materials (an understanding of leadership, policy and innovation), exploring your local practice (to gain new insights), and discussion with your tutor and study group peers (thinking as a leader). The course represents a guided enquiry into what leadership might achieve locally and the ways in which you might develop your potential as a change agent.</dc:description>

Through this course you will gain skills which will enable you to gather and review evidence in order to determine enhancements in service delivery. If you are engaged in audit, practice improvement and similar work, lead or work with a practice development team or work with others on their research (e.g. practising as a research nurse), this will be a valuable course for you. The course is also valuable for healthcare practitioners making contributions within social care environments, charities and similar or anywhere that healthcare is a concern and where there is a need for service improvement. This course is self-contained and develops a coherent set of skills and so is open to both individual students and sponsors who wish to develop a cohort of their practitioners in this area of work.</dc:description>
			<dc:description>Researching and evaluating healthcare practice assists you to play a leading role in service improvements through an appreciation of healthcare quality, research, evidence evaluation and skill analysis. You will conduct a series of investigations (some at work, others are studied privately or with tutor group colleagues), to explore the basis for service improvement, including robust and appropriate underpinning evidence, best research practice and skill analysis. The course provides opportunities to explore the work of the researcher, look at ways to evaluate evidence, and explore approaches that can assist you to unpick skills practised locally.</dc:description>

			<dc:description xsi:type="xcriTerms:careerOutcome">This course is relevant to a wide range of practitioners in health and social care settings: if you are already or wish in the future to engage in project-working with others, if you are charged with leadership and change agency roles, if you hope to innovate in practice or if you aspire to coach or advise others in their professional development. The course offers valuable opportunities to develop the communication and knowledge dissemination skills that are so important to practitioners who advance professional practice. The course enables you to enhance your reflective practice abilities and will appeal to those who see personal and collegiate reflection as an important vehicle for continual improvement in practice. Because no assumptions are made with regard to the health or social setting, the system within which the practitioner works, the course will also assist those working overseas, and in the voluntary sector (beyond the statutory provision in health or social care).</dc:description>
			<dc:description>This course provides a structure for a guided enquiry into advanced professional practice that will demonstrate your scholarship and enable you to make recommendations for improvement in your workplace. During this course you will undertake a detailed investigation of both evidence and experience. Your enquiry will focus on one of three possible areas of practice: leadership and change agency, practice skill development or quality assurance and service improvement. This will include exploring the most effective means to disseminate the best practice that you have discovered, through publication, presentation at conference, teaching or blogging within the electronic media.</dc:description>

			<dc:description xsi:type="xcriTerms:careerOutcome">If you successfully complete KYN101 you can claim a Certificate in Health and Social Care, which is widely recognised by employers. You can also opt to register for a Level 3 vocational qualification in health and social care alongside your academic studies - regarded as the 'gold standard' for carer competence in adult care practice. The programme enables you to reap a second harvest from the work you've done for KYN101 that contributes directly to your VQ. There will be an additional cost for this. An alternative integrated VQ Level 3 Diploma in Health and Social Care specifically related to the care of children and young people is also available. For further information, visit the NVQ website or email the VQ team and include KYN101 in your message header. Please note that VQs are not always recognised in nations outside of the UK and that all students seeking this option must be working in the sector, either paid or voluntarily.</dc:description>

			<dc:description>What causes mental distress and what can be done about it? What factors in the external environment affect mental health? This course examines the ways in which social, environmental, economic and political factors shape and constrain our understandings and experiences of mental health and distress. It explores diverse and frequently competing perspectives that characterise the world of mental health - lay, bio-medical, psychological, psychotherapeutic and social - learning from written and spoken accounts of people who have experienced mental distress. You'll look at the impact of these perspectives on mental health practice and service provision, and the implications for ethical and value-based practice.</dc:description>

			<dc:description>Ideas about the concept of mental health are hotly contested, and often personally and intellectually challenging. This course invites you to think differently about life's dilemmas by considering the views of all concerned, especially people experiencing mental distress. Using a holistic framework, it explores ideas and practice in mental health - encouraging you to review your own beliefs and experiences and to challenge yourself and others on a more informed footing. The course will appeal to a wide range of people - workers in health and social care, service users/survivors, friends and families, and anyone with a general interest in this complex and challenging topic.</dc:description>

In these circumstances, you must negotiate with your tutor to get their agreement to submit your assignment on paper.</mlo:assessment>
			<mlo:prerequisite>This is a key introductory Level 1 course. Level 1 courses provide core subject knowledge and study skills needed for both higher education and distance learning, in preparation for study at Level 2. Professional communication skills for business studies can be taken alongside, before or after An introduction to business studies (B120). It is also suitable for students who have taken Understanding management (Y179) or Managing in the workplace (B121), or are considering starting a business studies course. It may also be of interest to learners on some more advanced-level business studies course. It is suitable for students from other language backgrounds who have a sound knowledge of everyday English and want to develop business specific language in reading and writing. If you are new or a less confident learner, start with Understanding management (Y179). This is an Openings course, also at Level 1 but worth 15 credits. Designed with lots of support and no examination, it will give you a gentle introduction to this subject and to OU study. If you successfully complete this Openings course, you'll be ready to study LB160. If you have any doubt about the suitability of the course, please contact our Student Registration &amp; Enquiry Service.</mlo:prerequisite>

			<dc:description>Pure mathematics is one of the oldest creative human activities and this course introduces its main topics. Group Theory explores sets of mathematical objects that can be combined - such as numbers, which can be added or multiplied, or rotations and reflections of a shape, which can be performed in succession. Linear Algebra explores 2- and 3-dimensional space and systems of linear equations, and develops themes arising from the links between these topics. Analysis , the foundation of calculus, covers operations such as differentiation and integration, arising from infinite limiting processes. You'll need a sound knowledge of mathematics as developed in Using mathematics (MST121) to study this course.</dc:description>

			<dc:description>The course provides an introduction to four major topics of modern applied statistics: medical statistics, time series, multivariate analysis, and Bayesian statistics. It's ideal if you've already studied a general introductory statistics course and wish to broaden your knowledge of the field. The course emphasises underlying principles and practical applications rather than technical details. Use of the computer is an essential component - the course includes SPSS and WinBUGS software, which you'll use to analyse data and develop your understanding of statistics. You'll need mathematical competence at the level developed by Using mathematics (MST121), and statistical competence at the level developed by Analysing data (M248).</dc:description>

			<mlo:assessment>Assessment is an essential part of the teaching, so you are expected to complete it all. But if you unavoidably miss or do badly in an assignment, some courses allow you a 'substitution score' for this assignment. In M249, this rule can apply to one tutor-marked assignment only. You will be given more detailed information when you begin the course. Please note that TMAs for all undergraduate mathematics and statistics courses must be submitted on paper as - due to technical reasons - we are unable to accept TMAs via our eTMA system.</mlo:assessment>
			<learningOutcome>Successful study of this course should improve your skills in analysing ad interpreting data, communicating statistical ideas clearly and succinctly, and in using professional software.</learningOutcome>
			<mlo:prerequisite>This is a Level 2 statistics course and you need to have a good knowledge of the subject area, obtained either through Level 1 study with the OU, or by doing equivalent work at another university. You require a good knowledge of statistical ideas and methods at an introductory level. The statistical prerequisites are revised in the Introduction to statistical modelling . They include: graphical and numerical data summaries; the basic statistical distributions including the normal, exponential, uniform, binomial and Poisson distributions; confidence intervals and significance tests, correlations and contingency tables. No knowledge of regression is required. If you have taken Analysing data (M248) you should have the required statistical background. The course also requires a mathematical knowledge similar to that expected in an introductory statistical course such as Analysing data (M248). If you have passed M248, or done well in Discovering mathematics (MU123), or passed Using mathematics (MST121) your mathematical knowledge should be ample. You are expected to be familiar with mathematical notation, to be able to follow short algebraic arguments, to handle the logarithm and exponential functions, and to use formulae. No knowledge of calculus, differentiation or integration is required. Please note that it is our experience that you are more likely to complete your course successfully if you have acquired your prerequisite knowledge through passing the recommended courses. You are assumed to have some experience of using a computer. If you would like more information about this course, you can view or download the first unit Introduction to Statistical Modelling here. A diagnostic quiz that will enable you to determine whether you are adequately prepared for this course can also be found on the Stats Choices website . This website also contains more information about the statistics courses available to you. If you have any doubt about the suitability of the course, please contact our Student Registration &amp; Enquiry Service.</mlo:prerequisite>

			<learningOutcome>the fundamental concepts associated with object-oriented programming (object, class, protocol, hierarchy, inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, collaboration, etc.) to apply and extend your knowledge of programming concepts within an object-oriented programming context. In Block 1 you will interact with a micro world of graphical objects to explore basic object-oriented ideas. However, soon you will be getting to grips with Java code and syntax and will begin writing your own simple object-oriented code using the BlueJ IDE. Basic object-oriented concepts such as attribute, state, protocol, class and subclass are introduced, initially through interaction with the micro world, and then in the context of writing Java code. By the end of the block, you will be expected to write short methods (the smallest units of code in Java) to specification. Block 2 continues the teaching about fundamental object-oriented ideas, by investigating inheritance hierarchies, overriding methods, abstract classes, interfaces, polymorphism, re-use of code, static methods and variables. Along the way, you'll learn about creating your own classes, about the facilities of Java for selection and iteration, and more about some of the core, provided Java classes. Different kinds of errors are discussed, along with debugging in the BlueJ environment. After discussion of the need to design code, you will be expected to be able to implement to specification a class along with its methods. Block 3 introduces a subset of the Java collection classes, and related issues such as iteration. You are guided to apply your knowledge from Blocks 1 and 2, along with the new classes being introduced, to increasingly complex programming exercises. The skill of appropriately utilising a provided library of classes (searching for a useful class and method, for example) is explicitly developed in this context, and re-use by composition is discussed. Block 4 begins by investigating how data is written to and from files in Java and how objects can be made persistent by writing them to file. The block then goes on to discuss software testing in an object-oriented context and the use of the testing tool JUnit. Finally the block puts what you have learnt in this course into the context of software development - a set of activities, stages and techniques which help individuals and teams to write software that meets its users' requirements.</learningOutcome>
			<mlo:prerequisite>The course is suitable for students who have previously taken a Level 1 course involving computer programming such as M150 (now discontinued), or who have equivalent programming knowledge. It assumes: knowledge of, and facility with, basic programming concepts such as assignment to variables, sequence, selection and iteration a general familiarity with the basic components and working of a computer study skills appropriate to Level 2 study.

			<dc:description>If you want to specialise in computing, this is the course for you. It's also suitable if you have a mathematical background and are considering computing, or have an interest in the theoretical underpinning of computing. The course covers essential formal and theoretical concepts, and fundamentals of computer science such as specification and abstraction in code; data structures; and data types and classes. It then investigates efficiency and proof of correctness of programs, providing a basis for formal methods of software development, and includes an introduction to formal logic. Mathematical ideas (such as sets and functions) are introduced where they help to clarify computing concepts.</dc:description>

			<mlo:prerequisite>This is a Level 2 course. It requires little previous knowledge, but it is important that you have suitable previous experience in organised thinking and the use of symbols. Ideally, you will have competence in basic algebra and some experience of computer code. Previous experience of programming is not required (although it will be useful). Some knowledge of manipulative algebra is assumed in a few places, but is not important in most of the course. If you have no experience of working with symbols we recommend that you study the introductory mathematics course Discovering mathematics (MU123) (or Using mathematics (MST121)).

			<dc:description>This course covers the construction, recognition and classification of geometric entities (tilings, friezes, wallpaper patterns, regular solids, crystal structures) and algebraic entities (symmetry groups, cyclic and abelian groups, and other groups of low order). The geometry and algebra are strongly interconnected: the geometric classification is done in terms of symmetry groups. After revising the basics and introducing tilings and friezes, Groups teaches you to construct and classify cyclic groups; the finitely presented abelian groups; and certain other groups. Geometry continues the study of geometric objects using their symmetry groups. You need a good understanding of the basics of group theory, linear algebra and algebraic manipulation, as in Pure mathematics (M208).</dc:description>

They are intended only for students who have recent experience of higher education in a related subject, preferably with the OU. Although the course is self-contained and all the essential material is revised in the introductory section, you are likely to find it hard going if you are not at all familiar with group-theoretic and geometric thinking. You could get the necessary background from our Level 2 mathematics course Pure mathematics (M208). Students are more likely to complete this course successfully if they have acquired their prerequisite knowledge through passing M208. The introductory block of this course revises the essential material from M208, but on the assumption that you have seen it before. Your regional or national centre will be able to tell you where you can see reference copies of M208. To help you decide whether or not you are ready to start M336 we have devised a diagnostic quiz .

			<dc:description>This course introduces models to describe patterns of events that occur in time (such as earthquakes), and in space (for instance, the occurrence of a species of plant). Situations that occur only at discrete time points, including the ruin of a gambler, are studied. Probability models are developed for those situations, such as the spread of an epidemic, in which events may occur at any time. The course ends with other situations involving probability including genetics and changes in stockmarket prices. You are expected to be reasonably competent in calculus and algebra.</dc:description>

			<mlo:prerequisite>This is a Level 3 course. Level 3 courses build on study skills and subject knowledge acquired from studies at Levels 1 and 2. They are intended only for students who have recent experience of higher education in a related subject, preferably with the OU. You are expected to have a basic knowledge of probability: probability functions for discrete random variables and probability density functions for continuous random variables; the binomial, Poisson, geometric, exponential and normal distributions; the Poisson process. You are also expected to have a reasonable degree of mathematical competence. Although any special techniques you need are taught in the course, it would be helpful if you had met differential equations and matrices. You could get the necessary knowledge from Analysing data (M248). Another Open University Level 2 mathematical course, Mathematical methods and models (MST209) is also relevant. We have tried to allow for the likelihood that not everyone will have taken those courses, and a revision of fundamental notions of probability and probability models and of some basic mathematical techniques is included in the first book. Close study of that, as early as you can, would be good preparation for the rest of the course. However, we do advise students they are more likely to complete this course successfully if they have acquired their prerequisite knowledge through passing one of the courses mentioned above. You can get an idea of the level of mathematical competence required by looking at texts from MST209, which gives a useful introduction to techniques. Your regional or national centre will be able to tell you where you can see reference copies, or you can buy selected materials from Open University Worldwide Ltd (see the Open University Worldwide website for details). A diagnostic quiz that will enable you to determine whether you are adequately prepared for M343 can be found on the StatsChoices website where you can also find out more about the statistics courses available to you.

			<dc:description>This course covers statistical modelling where a response variable depends on one or several explanatory variables: such as how well patients respond to a treatment, given their age and disease severity; or how different strains of wheat compare when grown in various conditions. Taking a practical approach, you'll use real problems and data to stimulate analyses and their interpretation. Statistical tools are introduced, and use of the statistical software package, GenStat (supplied) is taught. You need a reasonable understanding of basic statistical ideas, as developed by Analysing data (M248). You'll learn to use the most important methods of analysing data - a skill that too few people have.</dc:description>

			<mlo:prerequisite>This is a Level 3 course. Level 3 courses build on study skills and subject knowledge acquired from studies at Levels 1 and 2. They are intended only for students who have recent experience of higher education in a related subject, preferably with the OU. This course follows the Level 2 introductory course Analysing data (M248) , which is an excellent basis from which to start M346. You need a basic knowledge of the ideas of statistical science at the level of M248: a theoretical grounding is not expected, but you should have a conceptual understanding of basic topics and should be able to apply the ideas and interpret the answers they give. The topics include histograms, boxplots and scatterplots; normal, Poisson and binomial distributions; the central limit theorem; confidence intervals; hypothesis testing; simple linear regression; correlation. All these are reviewed in the early units of the course. Some experience of using a statistical software package is expected, although you are not expected to be familiar with GenStat. If you used MINITAB in M248 you will have the necessary expertise. The course also requires a mathematical knowledge similar to that expected in an introductory statistical course such as M248 . You are expected to be familiar with mathematical notation, to be able to follow short algebraic arguments, to handle the logarithm and exponential functions, and to use formulae. You will not be expected to follow complicated algebraic arguments nor to produce a great deal of algebra in your written work. You can find out more information about studying statistics, including diagnostic quizzes to assess your readiness, on the StatsChoices website .

			<dc:description>This online course provides you with the mathematical underpinning for statistical methods in general and - in particular - for other OU statistics courses. You will gain a thorough grounding in mathematical statistics, together with generic skills. You will study distribution theory, leading on to the theory of statistical inference developed under both classical and Bayesian approaches. In the classical case, you will focus on maximum likelihood estimation in particular. You'll also explore the development of these ideas in the context of linear modelling (regression and extensions). Before you start the course, you should understand basic statistical ideas and be reasonably competent in calculus, algebra and matrices.</dc:description>

They are intended only for students who have recent experience of higher education in a related subject, preferably with the OU. You should have a basic knowledge of the ideas and concepts of statistical science at the level of Analysing data (M248). Relevant topics include: normal, Poisson and binomial distributions; the central limit theorem; point estimation; maximum likelihood estimation; confidence intervals; hypothesis testing; simple linear regression; correlation. All these are reviewed in the course. It would be an advantage if you have also studied Practical modern statistics (M249), especially Book 4 on Bayesian statistics. However, such knowledge is not assumed but re-developed from scratch. Block 4 of M347 covers some of the same topics as Linear statistical modelling (M346), but from a quite different viewpoint (theoretical rather than practical). It is not expected that you will have studied M346 before you study M347 (or vice versa); if you are taking both courses they can be studied in either order. You are also expected to have a reasonable degree of mathematical competence, up to the level of Exploring mathematics (MS221) . The most relevant mathematical techniques are calculus, algebra and matrices. The more at ease you are with basic differentiation and integration the better; there will be quite a lot of algebraic manipulation; matrix properties and manipulations will be kept simple. Supporting mathematical material will be provided as part of the course. If you are planning to study Mathematical methods and models (MST209), we recommend that you study it before this course.

			<dc:description>This advanced computing course offers perspectives on relational databases. It introduces database management systems and the facilities required to store and access large collections of data in a shared user environment. This is followed by a theory of relations, underpinning topics such as data modelling and database architecture; the database language SQL; and the development of a practical database system. Also considered are issues surrounding the on-going development and application of relational database technologies, including the role of JAVA and XML. You should already be familiar with program construction and using files and operating systems, as taught in our Level 2 computing courses.</dc:description>

			<learningOutcome>The main body of the course focuses on the development of a database to meet specified requirements. This development will assume requirements analysis has taken place and that a requirements document is available. The development model will make use of conceptual data modelling, relational algebra and SQL for the expression of design and implementation artefacts. The course is organised in five blocks. Block 1 introduces the context of databases as part of an information system, which may be used by many people for different purposes and with different requirements. You will then examine the types of software that are necessary for accessing a database, and how each database has to be specially designed to satisfy the requirements of its users. Block 2 introduces the mathematical theory underpinning relational technologies and shows ways that the theory is used in the database environment. Block 3 is concerned with relational database management systems, and, in particular, the use of the database language SQL, the recognised standard for defining and accessing a relational database. Block 4 is a detailed analysis of the steps involved in developing and implementing a database system. It examines, in depth, the tasks and techniques appropriate for each step in the development process and makes detailed comparisons between implementation alternatives and data representations. Block 5 focuses on the on-going development and application of relational database technologies in the context of JAVA and XML.</learningOutcome>
			<mlo:prerequisite>This is a challenging Level 3 course. Level 3 courses build on study skills and subject knowledge acquired from studies at Levels 1 and 2. They are intended only for students who have recent experience of higher education in a related subject, preferably with the OU. You must be familiar with the use of computers - particularly the construction of programs - using files, and operating systems. You could get the necessary knowledge from a Level 2 computing course. We would recommend prior completion of Object-oriented Java programming (M250) or other recent experience of higher education in a related subject.

			<dc:description>The computing systems that support any large enterprise now use concurrency and distribution. In this course, you'll look at the theory and practice of developing such systems, and learn about the advanced use of Java - such as Java's concurrency features and the layered approach for building large enterprise systems - using Java Enterprise Edition as a practical illustration. You'll also examine heterogeneous and mobile systems and security. The course uses examples, from simple stand-alone systems, distributed systems with web access, and online auction systems. You should be familiar with Java 5.0, perhaps by successfully completing Putting Java to work (M257).</dc:description>

			<dc:description>Don't expect a conventional computing course with this one! It deals with one of humanity's oldest dreams: creating machines with powers and mental abilities similar to our own. You'll examine work at the frontiers of research in computing, where ideas from biology are inspiring computer scientists to find new solutions to old problems - particularly in the quest to build truly intelligent computer systems. The course begins with a survey of traditional and modern approaches to artificial intelligence, bringing out the concepts that underlie them, and then explores the theory and applications of two classes of system inspired by biology: neural networks and evolutionary computation.</dc:description>

			<dc:description>Number theory looks at some classical problems concerning the integers, including the solution of Diophantine equations; the distribution of prime numbers; the theory of congruences; quadratic reciprocity; and the theory of continued fractions. Mathematical logic sets out to prove Godel's incompleteness theorem, a result of philosophical importance for the limits of mathematical proof. To lay the ground for this theorem we look first at apparently different notions of computability that all in fact coincide, and then discuss a formal proof system for basic number theory.</dc:description>

			<dc:description>As the final element in our MSc computing qualifications, M801 draws together your practical and academic skills and knowledge. You will undertake a detailed research project, and be guided by a supervisor through the thirteen-month period of work, which leads to the production of a dissertation (10,000-15,000 words). There is preliminary work to be undertaken before the course begins - this means that you may need to be working on this as well as the final module for your diploma. You must already hold a relevant Postgraduate Diploma before you can take this course.</dc:description>

			<dc:description>The calculus of variations, which plays an important role in both pure and applied mathematics, dates from the time of Newton. Development of the subject started mainly with the work of Euler and Lagrange in the eighteenth century and still continues. This course, which for most students begins the MSc in Mathematics programme, develops the theory of the calculus of variations. It also introduces other topics including the calculus of functions of several real variables; and ideas of convergence, particularly of sequences of functions and normed vector spaces - a working knowledge of which is required both in this and other modules in the MSc in Mathematics programme.</dc:description>

			<dc:description>Relevant to scientists and engineers as well as mathematicians, this introduction to basic theory and simpler approximation schemes covers systems with two degrees of freedom. It introduces the geometric aspects of the two-dimensional phase space, the importance of fixed points and how they can be classified, and the notion of a limit cycle. You'll develop schemes to approximate the solutions of autonomous and non-autonomous equations to understand how these solutions behave. Periodically forced nonlinear oscillators and nonlinear oscillators with periodically time-varying parameters leading to parametric resonances are discussed, along with the stability of these solutions and tests for obtaining stability.</dc:description>

			<dc:description>Number theory has its roots in ancient history but particularly since the seventeenth century, it has undergone intensive development using ideas from many branches of mathematics. In spite of the subject's maturity, many problems that are easy to state and understand still exist - for example, is there an even number greater than 2 that is not the sum of two primes? In this course (and in Analytic number theory II ( M829)), you'll study number theory using techniques from analysis, in particular the convergence of series and the calculus of residues. The course is based on readings from T. M. Apostol's Introduction to Analytic Number Theory .</dc:description>

			<dc:description>Modern mathematics places emphasis on classes of functions, rather than special properties of individual functions. Functions are considered as elements of a set and these sets can usually be given the additional structure of a linear and topological space. The interplay of these structures gives the subject its characteristic flavour. Along with the set of functions, this course considers sets of mappings from the set into various other sets, particularly, linear mappings onto the set itself (operators) and into complex numbers (linear functionals).</dc:description>

			<dc:description>Approximation theory is concerned with approximating functions of a given class using functions from another, usually more elementary, class. A simple example is the problem of approximating a function such as e x by means of polynomial functions. The efficient solution of such problems is of great importance for computing, and this course will give you a general introduction to the mathematical theory behind many approximation methods in common use.</dc:description>

No explicit use is made of the theory of complex variables, but knowledge of the subject, as in Complex analysis (M337) (or the discontinued M332), would be useful, since it has many techniques in common with approximation theory. All teaching is in English and your proficiency in the English language should be adequate for the level of study you wish to take. We strongly recommend that students have achieved an IELTS (International English Language Testing System) score of at least 7. To assess your English language skills in relation to your proposed studies you can visit the IELTS website .

			<dc:description>This course teaches advanced mathematical methods with the aid of Maple, an algebraic computing language with graphics and numerical capabilities, which you'll be taught how to use. Although the emphasis is on mathematical methods, you'll use Maple partly to extend the use of these methods, partly to help you to visualise the mathematics and partly to enable you to combine conventional analytic techniques with numerical analysis. You'll explore various forms of approximations, perturbation expansions, accelerated convergence methods including Pade approximants, asymptotic expansions of integrals and some eigenvalue problems.</dc:description>

			<dc:description>There has recently been an explosion of interest in the mathematics of fractals - sets whose geometry cannot easily be described in classical terms. There's no simple definition but all fractals have a highly intricate structure. Many fractals contain copies of themselves at many different scales, and computer pictures have shown that such sets (which are often very beautiful) are a very good representation of shapes of natural phenomena such as clouds, mountains and ferns. This course deals with the theory of fractals and their geometry, and looks at examples to which the theory can be applied.</dc:description>

			<mlo:prerequisite>You must be registered for the MSc in Mathematics or for another qualification towards which the course can count. The course is a dissertation and assumes a high level of mathematical maturity. It is normally available only after you have passed at least four other courses in the MSc in Mathematics programme. Because the 'Advances in approximation theory' topic builds on the material in Advanced mathematical methods (M833) and Approximation theory (M832), you will normally need to have passed both M833 and M832 to be accepted to study this topic. You will normally be required to have passed Calculus of Variations and advanced calculus (M820) before studying the topic on 'Calculus of variations'. The number of students on each topic may need to be limited so you are advised to register early, noting that you may not be offered your first choice of topic. All teaching is in English and your proficiency in the English language should be adequate for the level of study you wish to take. We strongly recommend that students have achieved an IELTS (International English Language Testing System) score of at least 7.

The course does not assume a working knowledge of any particular computer systems or management methods, but you should feel comfortable with studying text material and understanding simple diagrams. The course also involves simple mathematical expressions for the topic of software estimation. We expect you to be working, or planning to work, in a software-related occupation, perhaps as a software developer or a software user, possibly in a management capacity so that your connection to software is indirectly through the people you manage. The assignments on M882 ask you to reflect on case studies of real software projects, applying what you have learnt during your study, so this connection to software-related employment is important.

			<dc:description>One of the best ways to ensure the quality of any product or service is to get the requirements for it right. This course examines requirements engineering (RE), which is used to analyse business problems and develop requirements specifications, by eliciting and documenting the requirements of those affected stakeholders. The specification can then be used to develop an appropriate solution to the problem. In this course, we assume that the eventual solution will be computer based. Students will have the opportunity to engage in small group-collaboration in a wiki environment to emulate real-life RE practice.</dc:description>

			<dc:description>The protection of information assets underpins the commercial viability and profitability of all enterprises and the effectiveness of public sector organisations. It should not be left to chance. If you work in an organisation concerned (directly or indirectly) with valuable information assets, this practical course will enable you to understand and manage strategic and operational aspects of information security, including IT governance and risk analysis and management. It will also provide the knowledge and skills needed to plan the implementation of an information security management system that provides efficient, effective safeguards and responds to your organisation's needs.</dc:description>

			<learningOutcome>After studying this course you will be able to: understand contemporary issues in information security management analyse and prioritise information security risks identify countermeasures and review techniques appropriate to the management of information security risks understand the policy and technology trade-offs involved in developing information security systems of adequate quality locate, read, comprehend and evaluate developments in the field as they appear in contemporary professional and research publications. It is important to realise that information security management is a 'big picture' subject concerned with getting the balance of technology, physical and social factors correct. As such, there is no special emphasis on any one factor; this is not a course specifically about security technology and you will not, for instance, learn how to configure a firewall as part of the core teaching of M886.</learningOutcome>
			<mlo:prerequisite>You can take this as a stand-alone course and it requires no formal qualifications for entry. However, it is a postgraduate level course, and you will be expected to have appropriate skills at this level, which might be developed from previous study (to HNC/HND level or above) or professional or commercial experience. In particular, you will need report-writing skills, since the work you are expected to submit in your assignments and examination will consist mainly of reports. M886's assessment involves a significant amount of practical work, including the building of an Information Security Management System for a part of an organisation with which you are familiar. To successfully complete your studies of M886 you will therefore need access to information about your chosen organisation. This often entails obtaining the permission, and possibly the active support, of the manager of that area and we recommend that you make any necessary arrangements before the start of the course.

			<dc:description>In today's interconnected web, systems integration grows ever more important. Every organisation needs to bring together data and services from a variety of sources, and written in a variety of programming languages. M887 describes in detail, with sample programs, a number of technologies central to developing integrated internet-based applications. These include enterprise servers that provide the backbone of an organisation's IT provision; XML and JSON which are the main ways of exchanging information between programs; SOAP and REST which are the two chief paradigms for web services; and the impact on systems integration of open source and cloud computing.</dc:description>

			<dc:description>Enterprise systems often employ two very different technologies: object-oriented programming for implementing applications and relational databases for maintaining persistent data (objects). This course explores the different ways that we can overcome the mismatch between object and relational database technologies so that object-oriented applications can store and retrieve objects to and from relational databases effectively and efficiently. M888 will be presented fully online within the virtual learning environment (VLE). All the study materials are externally sourced from online journals, books, conference proceedings, technical reports and tutorials provided via the OU Library, software vendors' and other websites.</dc:description>

			<dc:description>This course is designed to help you develop your knowledge and understanding of the teaching of mathematics. It is suitable for any Key Stage, and will broaden your ideas about how people learn and use mathematics. There is no formal examination: assessment is based on two tutor-marked assignments and an end-of-module assessment. In order to complete the assessments, you will need access to learners of mathematics. Students on this course have worked with a variety of learners from Key Stage 2 pupils to adults. Places are allocated on a 'first come, first served' basis, so you should register as early as you can.</dc:description>

			<mlo:assessment>You can choose whether to submit your tutor-marked assignments (TMAs) on paper or online through the eTMA system. You may want to use the eTMA system for some of your assignments but submit on paper for others. This is entirely your choice.</mlo:assessment>
			<learningOutcome>The course starts from the assumption that mathematics education is an intrinsically worthwhile enterprise; it is therefore worth striving to understand its processes in order to do it better. The course aims arise from the nature of mathematics education as a process of human interaction, which means that certain aspects of the course can only be engaged with through practice. From this perspective, the course offers ways of working that contribute to your own mathematical development and, by enhancing your work with other learners, can enrich learning and confidence.</learningOutcome>
			<mlo:prerequisite>This course is intended for anyone with an interest in the teaching and learning of mathematics. The focus of the mathematical content of the course is around the level of Key Stage 3 but the educational issues that are discussed are relevant for all stages. The course is open to everyone, though it particularly has in mind teachers, teaching assistants, home-school parents and special educational needs coordinators working with learners of mathematics. If you are planning to study towards the Graduate Diploma in Mathematics Education, unless you have a strong mathematics background, you should plan to study this as the first module in the diploma. In order to complete the assessments, you will need regular access to at least one other learner of mathematics, from Key Stage 2 pupils to adults, on whom to try out approximately two tasks per week. If you have any doubt about the suitability of the course, please contact our Student Registration &amp; Enquiry Service.</mlo:prerequisite>

			<dc:description>Exploring mathematics builds on the concepts and techniques in Using mathematics (MST121) and uses the same software. It looks at questions underlying some of those techniques, such as why particular patterns occur in mathematical solutions and how you can be confident that a result is true. It introduces the role of reasoning and offers opportunities to investigate mathematical problems. Together with Using mathematics this course will give you a good foundation for higher-level mathematics, science and engineering courses. Even if you don't intend to study further, you will gain a good, university-level understanding of the nature and scope of mathematics. You are advised to be confident with the content of Using mathematics (MST121), or equivalent from elsewhere, before commencing study of this course.</dc:description>

			<mlo:assessment>Please note that TMAs for all undergraduate mathematics and statistics courses must be submitted on paper as - due to technical reasons - we are unable to accept TMAs via our eTMA system. Each TMA typically consists of six questions, covering one Block of the course. Each of the questions typically involves some calculation, algebraic manipulation, creating and/or interpreting a graph, some written work to explain your interpretations and conclusions, and may involve using the course software and providing printouts. The first TMA is to be submitted about eight weeks after the start of the course. The examination contains two parts. The first consists of short answer questions covering the whole of the course. The second contains longer questions, one on each Block, and you are required to attempt up to two of these.</mlo:assessment>
			<learningOutcome>Successful study of this course should improve your skills in: communicating mathematical ideas clearly and succinctly working with abstract concepts thinking logically constructing logical arguments finding solutions to problems using a computer algebra software package.</learningOutcome>
			<mlo:prerequisite>This course is the third part of the mathematics entry suite that starts with Discovering mathematics (MU123) and goes on to Using mathematics (MST121) and MS221. Your choice of which to take depends on how much mathematical knowledge you already have and on the degree you have in mind. It is not advisable to take either MST121 or MS221 in the same year as MU123, and you should not take MS221 before studying MST121. It is possible to study MST121 and MS221 together in a single year, as if they were a 60-credit course, since the material in the two is linked. They have been designed with this possibility in mind, so the assessment is appropriately spaced. However, we should recommend doing this only if you have plenty of study time - including time to study the MST121 preparatory materials - and you have a high level of confidence and fluency with algebraic manipulation obtained, for example, as part of an A-Level (or equivalent) in mathematics. Otherwise, it would be better to take them consecutively rather than together. If you have any doubt about the suitability of the course, or about choosing the most suitable mathematics entry course, please contact our Student Registration &amp; Enquiry Service , or look at the Maths Choices website .</mlo:prerequisite>

			<dc:description>This course focuses on three areas of applied mathematics. Waves builds your understanding of wave motion using vibrating strings and sound waves as examples. Techniques for solving linear partial differential equations are also developed. The diffusion section describes heat flow, and the flow of particles which follow random walks. Connections between random processes and deterministic diffusion processes are explained. The third section introduces variational principles and calculus through simple problems, such as determining the shortest line between two points on a curved surface. The Euler-Lagrange equation and the Lagrangian re-formulation of Newtonian mechanics are then explored.</dc:description>

Your regional or national centre will be able to tell you where you can see reference copies of the courses, or you can buy selected texts from Open University Worldwide Ltd. Applied mathematics at the level of MST209 would be suitable preparation, and it is assumed that you have sufficient knowledge of algebra, calculus and geometry (at the level of MS221) to have tackled such a Level 2 applied mathematics course. Some exposure to ideas of probability and statistics (at the level of MST121) would be an advantage. Students are more likely to complete this course successfully if they have acquired their prerequisite knowledge through passing MST209 (preferably with a grade 1 or 2).

			<dc:description>This three-block course will be of interest if you wish to explore and experiment with mathematics using computers. The first block introduces you to computer-assisted algebra techniques using Maple , a software package that allows your computer to symbolically manipulate, numerically evaluate, and graphically visualise mathematical expressions. The second block is about dynamical systems with an emphasis on chaos. Much of this part of the course is taught using traditional pencil-and-paper methods but Maple still frequently comes into play. The final block mainly concerns computer simulations of random processes, again using Maple .</dc:description>

			<dc:description>This broad, enjoyable introduction to university-level mathematics assumes some prior knowledge, as described on our MathsChoices website. The course shows how mathematics can be applied to answer questions from science, technology, and everyday life. You will study a range of fundamental techniques, including calculus, recurrence relations, matrices and vectors and statistics. Using specialist mathematical software is an integral part of the course, and you will learn how the speed and accuracy of a computer can be employed to solve practical problems. The skills of communicating results and defining problems are also developed. This course is key in providing you with a good foundation for higher-level mathematics, science and engineering. At the MathsChoices website (mathschoices.open.ac.uk) there are quizzes, sample material and advice to help you determine if MST121 is right for you.</dc:description>

			<mlo:assessment>Please note that TMAs for all undergraduate mathematics and statistics courses must be submitted on paper as - due to technical reasons - we are unable to accept TMAs via our eTMA system. The assessment during the course consists of four tutor-marked assignments (TMAs) (all approximately six weeks apart), and, at the end of the course, a consolidation CMA. (There is also a TMA and a CMA, associated with the revision material, but your scores for these do not count towards your course result.) All TMAs are to be submitted on paper, and CMAs must be submitted online using our eCMA system. Assessment is an essential part of the teaching, so you are expected to complete it all. But if you unavoidably miss or do badly in an assignment in MST121 you are allowed a 'substitution score' for one of the TMAs only. You will be given more detailed information when you begin the course. The examination consists of two parts, both covering the whole of the course. The first section contains multiple choice questions, the second short answer questions.</mlo:assessment>
			<learningOutcome>Successful study of this course should begin to develop your skills in: expressing problems in mathematical language finding solutions to problems communicating mathematical ideas clearly and succinctly.</learningOutcome>
			<mlo:prerequisite>This is a key introductory Level 1 course. Level 1 courses provide core subject knowledge and study skills needed for both higher education and distance learning, to help you progress to courses at Level 2. The course assumes that you already have a good knowledge and understanding of: the arithmetic of whole numbers, decimals and fractions (including negative numbers, powers and roots); algebraic manipulation, such as multiplying out brackets, factorisation of simple expressions, interpreting inequalities and solving linear and quadratic equations; properties of triangles, rectangles and circles; the trigonometric ratios sine, cosine and tangent; equations of straight lines; quadratic, exponential, logarithmic and trigonometric functions, and their graphs. A mathematical A-level, or a good pass in the highest-level GCSE mathematics (or the equivalent), would normally provide this. If all you need is a reminder of some of these topics, you can use the MST121 Revision Pack to revise them. However, if much of the list is unfamiliar, you should consider taking MST121 after completing our Level 1 course Discovering mathematics (MU123). MST121 relies on a very good understanding of most of MU123, or equivalent from previous study. MST121 is the second course in the mathematics entry suite, following on from Discovering mathematics (MU123) and leading to Exploring mathematics (MS221). Your choice of which to take depends on how much mathematical knowledge you already have and on the degree you have in mind. It is not advisable to take either MST121 or MS221 in the same year as MU123, and you should not take MS221 before MST121. If you start in October, it is possible to study MST121 and MS221 together in a single year, as if they were a 60-credit course, since the material in the two courses is linked. They have been designed with this possibility in mind, so the assessment is appropriately spaced. However, we would recommend doing this only if you have plenty of study time - including time to study the MST121 Revision Pack - and you have a high level of confidence and fluency with algebraic manipulation obtained, for example, as part of an A-level (or equivalent) in mathematics. Otherwise, it would be better to take them consecutively rather than together. If you have any doubt about the level of study, or about choosing the most suitable mathematics entry course with which you should start, please seek advice from our Student Registration &amp; Enquiry Service, or look at the Maths Choices website . The Maths Choices website also contains a self-assessment quiz to help you decide if MST121 is the right course for you. If you have any doubt about the level of study, please seek advice from our Student Registration &amp; Enquiry Service.</mlo:prerequisite>

			<mlo:prerequisite>This is a Level 2 course and you need a good knowledge of the subject area, obtained either from Level 1 study with the OU or from equivalent work at another university. Knowledge of mechanics is not needed, but we do not recommend the course if you have little mathematical experience. You need a good basic working knowledge of: algebra - you must be able to solve linear and quadratic equations with one unknown, to multiply and add polynomials, to factorise quadratic polynomials and to work with complex numbers geometry - you must know Pythagoras's theorem and how to use Cartesian coordinates, e.g. the equations of straight lines and circles trigonometry - you need to know the basic properties of the three trigonometric ratios sine, cosine and tangent, and the definitions of the corresponding inverse functions calculus - you must be able to differentiate and integrate a variety of functions, though great facility in integration is not necessary. Our diagnostic quiz Am I ready to start on MST209? will help you to determine whether you are adequately prepared for this course. The course is designed to follow Using mathematics (MST121) and Exploring mathematics (MS221). Students are more likely to complete this course successfully if they have acquired their prerequisite knowledge through passing those courses. You are advised to obtain a good pass in both of those courses first, or to make sure that you have reached an equivalent standard. If you have passed MST121, but not MS221 then there is some study material available to help you bridge the gap. The bridging material is available on the website . The online quiz will indicate whether or not you need to study this. Your regional or national centre will be able to tell you where you can see reference copies of the courses, or you can buy selected texts from Open University Worldwide Ltd .

			<mlo:prerequisite>MSXR209 is a Level 2 course and you need a good knowledge of applied mathematics and mechanics, obtained either from the first half of the OU course Mathematical methods and modelling (MST209) or from equivalent work on a predecessor course or at another university. To help you decide whether you have the necessary background, an online booklet Are you ready for MSXR209? is available. Knowledge of the following topics is required: solving first-order differential equations solving linear constant-coefficient second-order differential equations partial differentiation eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrices equations of motion for particles in one or two dimensions modelling springs, friction and air resistance solving systems of linear constant-coefficient differential equations. If you have any doubt about the level of pre-requisite mathematical knowledge please seek advice from our Student Registration &amp; Enquiry Service. The timing of the presentation of this course is such that this course can be taken in the same year as MST209 and these two courses complement each other. If you are doing MST209 in the same year as this course, then you should have reached the required level of mathematics and mechanics to study the study material before you come to the residential school and to understand the techniques you will be using at the residential school. Studying MSXR209 alongside MST209 will be beneficial to your understanding of the topics in the first half of MST209; however, you should be aware that MSXR209 is a 10-credit course that will take time to study, and you should only take the two courses together if you are sure that you will have the time to study both.</mlo:prerequisite>

			<dc:description>This course in object-oriented programming will teach you how to design and write small applications using Visual Basic Express. Software applications discussed in the course range from a very simple traffic survey application, to more complex applications that are linked to a database. Roughly one third of the course consists of important practical Visual Basic Express programming exercises, using web-based units. You'll also use printed course books that use a design language similar to Visual Basic (VB), to learn essential programming skills. You should be ready to study computing at Level 2 and ideally have some programming experience.</dc:description>

			<mlo:prerequisite>This interfaculty course is intended for students with a variety of backgrounds. The more mathematically inclined will see how their mathematics can be used to solve problems, while those with a technological interest will learn to appreciate the use of a mathematical framework to relate different ideas. This is a Level 3 course. Level 3 courses build on study skills and subject knowledge acquired from studies at Levels 1 and 2. They are intended only for students who have recent experience of higher education in a related subject, preferably with The Open University. A suitable preparation is a background in mathematics (such as Using mathematics (MST121) and Exploring mathematics (MS221)) and 60 credits at Level 2 in mathematics, science or technology. In particular, familiarity with matrix multiplication and the matrix formulation of simultaneous equations would be an advantage, although these are reviewed in the course. Please note that you are more likely to complete this course successfully if you have acquired your prerequisite knowledge through passing these courses. Your regional or national centre will be able to tell you where you can see reference copies of the suggested courses, or you can buy selected materials from Open University Worldwide Ltd. There is also a diagnostic quiz to help you to determine whether you are adequately prepared for this course. Don't worry if you haven't studied technology before. If you rely on common sense and accept certain statements of a scientific or technological nature, you should have no difficulty. Whatever your experience you should find plenty to interest you, as long as you go along with the interdisciplinary nature of the course. If you have any doubt about the suitability of the course, please contact our Student Registration &amp; Enquiry Service.</mlo:prerequisite>

			<mlo:assessment>Please note that TMAs for all undergraduate mathematics and statistics courses must be submitted on paper as - due to technical reasons - we are unable to accept TMAs via our eTMA system. The final TMA covers the whole of the course, and is compulsory if you wish to pass the course. The first iCMA, covering Unit 1, is to be submitted about two weeks after the start of the course. The first TMA is to be submitted about a month after the start. TMA questions typically involve calculating, creating and/or interpreting a graph or diagram, using algebra, and explaining your work and conclusions. The latter is one factor that makes MU123 a university-level course and it is a new approach for some students, who may find it challenging initially. Some TMAs may also include a short question covering a wider aspect of studying maths. As there is no examination, the final TMA aims to consolidate your learning across different aspects of the course.</mlo:assessment>
			<learningOutcome>Successful study of this course should begin to develop your skills in working with mathematical concepts and using them to solve problems. You will learn about: key ideas in mathematics, including some statistics, algebra, geometry and trigonometry mathematical vocabulary and notation introduced and developed in the course selection and use of mathematical techniques for solving problems interpretation of results in the context of real life situations simple mathematical arguments how to explain mathematical ideas from the course in writing development of skills in learning mathematics use of relevant ICT tools for learning and for working on mathematical problems describing problems mathematically analysing mathematical reasoning. The course contains many real world contexts such as journey planning, glaciers, supply and demand, depreciation, poverty levels, chance events, and medical conditions (such as cancer), to help illustrate mathematical topics.</learningOutcome>
			<mlo:prerequisite>This is a key introductory Level 1 course. Level 1 courses provide core subject knowledge and study skills needed for both higher education and distance learning, to help you progress to courses at Level 2. If you are new or a less confident learner, start with Starting with maths (Y182). This is an Openings course, also at Level 1 but worth 15 credits. Designed with lots of support and no examination, it will give you a gentle introduction to this subject and to OU study. If you successfully complete this Openings course, you'll be ready to study MU123. You are advised to have previous experience in mathematics, before commencing MU123. In particular, you should be confident with the following topics, which are covered in Y182 and briefly revised in MU123: arithmetic of numbers, including negative numbers and fractions scientific notation for numbers (sometimes known as standard form) powers of numbers including square roots using your scientific calculator effectively for the above topics, and for working with brackets and p using simple word formulas drawing and interpreting simple charts and graphs. You are not expected to have any skills in algebra before the course starts. It is essential that you establish whether or not your background and experience give you a sound basis on which to tackle MU123, since students who are appropriately prepared have the best chance of completing their studies successfully and get the most enjoyment out of it. You are strongly advised to follow the recommendations given in the Preparatory work section below. MU123 is part of the mathematics entry suite, leading to Using mathematics (MST121) and Exploring mathematics (MS221). Your choice of which of the three to take depends on how much mathematical knowledge you already have and on the degree you have in mind. You should start with MU123 if you're not confident with algebra and trigonometry to the level of a good pass in the highest-level GCSE mathematics, or equivalent, and then go on to MST121. For advice about where to begin your Level 1 study in maths, depending on your previous background and experience, please look at our Maths Choices website . The website also contains a self-assessment quiz to help you decide if MU123 is the right course for you. If you have any doubt about the suitability of the course, please contact our Student Registration &amp; Enquiry Service.</mlo:prerequisite>

			<dc:description>Studying law is stimulating in its own right, and it's also a smart career move. If you want to practise law professionally, a law degree is a first and necessary step - but it's also a great asset for many other careers that are not directly related to law. The Open University's Bachelor of Laws (Honours) (LLB) is the most popular undergraduate taught law degree programme in the UK. We offer it in collaboration with The College of Law - the UK's largest provider of professional legal education. The compulsory modules of this degree course cover the seven 'Foundations of Legal Knowledge' - the academic subjects required for a Qualifying Law Degree (QLD). These are set by The Solicitors Regulation Authority and The Bar Standards Board (the professional legal bodies). By the end of your studies, you'll have the legal awareness needed to understand and apply the law, together with skills of legal analysis and methods.</dc:description>

			<learningOutcome>Jobs directly related to law include solicitor, barrister, legal executive and paralegal. Solicitors and barristers usually work in private practice, in central or local government, commerce, industry, the armed forces or in professional bodies. Solicitors and barristers in England and Wales need to complete three stages of training: Academic - a Qualifying Law Degree (QLD) Vocational - a Legal Practice Course (LPC). If you successfully complete our QLD, the College of Law will guarantee you a place on its LPC (you need to take up this place within seven years of graduation) Professional - a training contract for solicitors or 'pupillage' for barristers. You can download our Recognition leaflet 3.13 Law for more information about the legal professions and details of professional recognition outside of England and Wales. The Bachelor of Laws (Honours) (LLB) can also open up many career options that are not just in the legal profession. Roles in finance, human resources, local government or general management all benefit from a legal background and from the discipline of studying a degree course.

			<dc:description>Psychology pervades just about every aspect of our personal and professional lives. The frequent query, 'What do you have in mind?' quite literally captures much of what psychology - the science of human behaviour - is all about. Studying our BSc (Honours) Psychology degree course (accredited by the British Psychological Society) gives you a window into the workings of the mind - why we do the things we do and how we interact with others. On this fascinating journey you'll gain knowledge and understanding of the different areas of psychology; develop valuable analytical and communication skills; and enhance your ability to work both independently and collaboratively, all of which will put you very much in the frame when it comes to employment opportunities. You'll also explore how psychologists use evidence derived from research to contribute to debates on matters such as ageing, crime, education, employment, forensic science, mental health, relationships and much more.</dc:description>

			<dc:description>Are you leaving the armed forces? If you've had a technical role, you're ideally placed to pass on your expertise and enthusiasm to the next generation - and forge yourself an in-demand second career as a physics teacher in the process. The BSc (Honours) Secondary Education in Physics provides an undergraduate route into teaching, with Qualified Teacher Status (QTS). You'll gain the knowledge and skills needed to teach across the lower secondary school science curriculum, with a special focus on physics - which you'll be trained to teach up to 'A' level. Flexible arrangements enable you fit your studies around the time you have available. You'll study the underpinning knowledge and theory of teaching and learning through distance learning, integrated with periods of teaching in two schools. Throughout your teacher training, you'll be well supported by a mentor and specialist tutor. Note: This degree course is currently only available to students who are leaving employment in the armed forces and who are normally resident in England.</dc:description>

			<learningOutcome>Currently, physics is designated as a 'shortage subject' in teaching - so there's a high demand for well qualified physics teachers in schools. Successful completion of the BSc (Honours) Secondary Education in Physics leads to a recommendation for Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) conferred by the General Teaching Council for England (GTCE). The science modules that you'll study on this degree course will advance your subject knowledge, develop your problem-solving abilities and enhance your mathematical and communication skills. You'll also become adept at the use of IT for learning and communication.

			<dc:description>What is the relationship between crime, social inequality and social exclusion? If anti-social behaviour is associated with family and community breakdown, mental health problems and substance abuse, how can we deal with these issues more effectively? The BA (Honours) Social Policy and Criminology takes the study of key questions in contemporary criminology and social policy to an advanced level - examining controversies about crime and disorder in the context of the current recession and cutbacks in social care, education and youth justice budgets. You'll also consider local and global concerns by exploring and comparing developments in different communities and countries. This degree course will equip you with the essential concepts and theories that underpin contemporary social policy and criminology, together with the skills required to evaluate and implement policy initiatives. You'll have your own specialist, subject-based academic support as well as opportunities to join in online communities of other social sciences students for teaching, learning and peer support.</dc:description>

			<dc:description>Design and innovation play a central role in our society. Far from being confined to the creative industries, they take us forward - in big and small ways - to improve every aspect of our lives. The Open University is at the forefront of teaching in this field; with a reputation for producing ground-breaking courses featuring online design studios, social networking, and inspiring study materials. The BA/BSc (Honours) Design and Innovation will develop your understanding of the huge impact that design can have. You'll learn skills and abilities that transfer across a wide range of disciplines, focusing on three key aspects: the process of design; working with and for others; and how design and innovation can be applied to real-world contexts. We offer four distinct pathways through this degree course, underpinned by the idea that Design and Innovation is a productive discipline, which explores problems by suggesting and considering solutions.</dc:description>

			<learningOutcome>A design and innovation approach can bring value to almost any activity, and is increasingly in demand with employers - for example in education, business, local government, leisure services, engineering, environment, and health. This degree course will develop your skills in design and innovation so that you can apply them in such 'embedded contexts' - areas outside the creative industries that are not traditionally thought of as 'creative', but nevertheless benefit hugely from the creativity that comes with design and innovation. As an Open University student you have a great advantage over other design students in that your learning can be put into practice as you study. The BA/BSc (Honours) Design and Innovation encourages you to apply the thinking, methods, and techniques you learn to your own context, enabling you to produce a portfolio of highly relevant design work. Additionally, the ability to think critically and responsibly about design problems is greatly valued by a wide range of employers.

			<dc:description>From microscopic electronic devices to super structures like dams, bridges and towers, engineering has a vast scope that touches every area of our lives. The BEng (Hons) is a fascinating and thorough general engineering degree course that explores the fundamentals of this creative and analytical subject, and provides a firm foundation on which to build a successful career. It covers the range of techniques, concepts and knowledge required by professional engineers - from materials and mechanics to design and modelling - and you'll have the opportunity to specialise in a number of areas: engineering design, environmental technologies, or energy and sustainability. Learning outcomes have been defined to fulfil the Engineering Council's requirements under UK-SPEC, and early on in your studies you'll compile a development plan aimed to fulfil your personal and professional aims. You'll work on real projects and there are two week-long residential schools where you'll team up with other students to create innovative solutions to challenging problems.</dc:description>

			<learningOutcome>On graduation you should be eligible to apply (via an appropriate engineering institution) to the Engineering Council for registration as Incorporated Engineer. You might want to carry on with your studies and work towards registration as a Chartered Engineer. There are two routes: The MEng - this postgraduate qualification builds on the BEng (Hons), and must be completed within four years of the undergraduate degree. It is accredited as satisfying the educational requirements for registration as Chartered Engineer (see the Engineering website for further information) The Postgraduate Diploma in Engineering, leading to the MSc in Engineering. Currently our qualifications have Engineering Council accreditation until the end of 2015, when we will seek re-accreditation beyond that date. If you'd like to know more about professional recognition, download our Recognition leaflet 3.3 Professional Engineering Institutions . Qualified engineers are much in demand for their rigorous approach to problem solving and high level of numeracy. These skills open up a wide range of other career opportunities - for example in management or finance - as well as in engineering itself.

			<dc:description>If you're already a graduate, with a first degree or masters degree in any subject from a UK university or recognised overseas university, you can enter our LLB directly at Stage 2. This graduate entry route - 240 credits of compulsory study - leads to a Bachelor of Laws (Honours) (LLB) degree that is recognised by the law profession as a Senior Status Law Degree. Studying law is stimulating in its own right, and it's also a smart career move. If you want to practise law professionally, a law degree is a first and necessary step - but it's also a great asset for many other careers that are not directly related to law. The Open University's LLB is the most popular undergraduate taught law degree programme in the UK. We offer it in collaboration with The College of Law - the UK's largest provider of professional legal education. The compulsory modules of this degree course cover the seven 'Foundations of Legal Knowledge' - the academic subjects required for a Qualifying Law Degree (QLD). These are set by The Solicitors Regulation Authority and The Bar Standards Board (the professional legal bodies). By the end of your studies, you'll have the legal awareness needed to understand and apply the law, together with skills of legal analysis and methods.</dc:description>

			<learningOutcome>Jobs directly related to law include solicitor, barrister, legal executive and paralegal. Solicitors and barristers usually work in private practice, in central or local government, commerce, industry, the armed forces or in professional bodies. Solicitors and barristers in England and Wales need to complete three stages of training: Academic - a Qualifying Law Degree (QLD) Vocational - a Legal Practice Course (LPC). If you successfully complete our QLD, the College of Law will guarantee you a place on its LPC (with the exception of the Accelerated LPC) - you need to take up this place within seven years of graduation Professional - a training contract for solicitors or 'pupillage' for barristers. You can download our Recognition leaflet 3.13 Law for more information about the legal professions and details of professional recognition outside of England and Wales. The Bachelor of Laws (Honours) (LLB) can also open up many career options that are not just in the legal profession. Roles in finance, human resources, local government or general management all benefit from a legal background and from the discipline of studying a degree course. Employers recognise that studying law gives you the chance to develop yourself beyond the boundaries of your normal work environment, giving you skills and knowledge that you can readily put into practice on a daily basis in your job.

			<mlo:prerequisite>Level 1 courses provide core subject knowledge and study skills needed for both higher education and distance learning, to help you progress to courses at Level 2. As this course builds on the skills and knowledge developed through the study of Exploring science (S104), we strongly advise you to study S104 first, but it can be studied alongside S104 if you wish. You should have basic mathematical skills (including drawing and interpreting graphs, and measurement and use of angles, using degrees). You should also have an understanding of basic scientific concepts. Both skill sets are covered in Exploring science .

			<dc:description>Do you want to further your study of science but worry that you lack confidence in mathematics? Then this course could be for you. Mathematical techniques are explained, and worked examples are included throughout the course, but the main emphasis is on providing examples for you to try for yourself. Many of the examples have a scientific flavour and detailed answers are also provided. As you work through the questions you will be able to revise the mathematical skills you already have, as well as learning and practising new ones, and your confidence in handling maths should increase. There are two online interactive assessments which give you instantaneous feedback on your answers; one can be attempted at any point during the course and provides practice for the end-of-module assessment with the same format. You are advised not to take Maths for Science as your first course.</dc:description>

			<abstract>This introductory course will develop your confidence in using mathematics as a tool in science.</abstract>
			<mlo:prerequisite>The course is not meant for absolute beginners in mathematics and is not recommended as your first Open University course. It is only one of a number of Level 1 mathematics courses available to you. You are strongly advised to attempt the short diagnostic quiz Is Maths for science the right course for you? to assess whether S151 is appropriate for your needs. If you intend to study Exploring science (S104), you are advised to do so before studying S151. The maths in S151 would be excellent preparation for The physical world (S207) or Astronomy (S282). However, it is not an adequate preparation if you intend to go on to Open University physics courses at Level 3 or mathematics courses at Level 2 or 3. The course assumes that you can add, subtract, multiply and divide positive and negative numbers and understand the use of brackets in numerical calculations. You should know how to express numbers as fractions and decimals and as simple powers (e.g. know that 1000 can be written as 10 3 ). You should be able to measure angles in degrees; plot and read data from straight-line graphs; use symbols to represent quantities and substitute numerical values into simple formulae. You will find the course more straightforward if you know how to add and multiply numerical fractions; rearrange very simple algebraic equations and find the gradient of a straight-line graph. But the course does not assume great confidence in these topics and they are all revised. If you have any doubt about the suitability of the course, please contact our Student Registration &amp; Enquiry Service. If you would like more information about the range of science short courses available you can visit the science short courses website . This site includes a frequently asked questions section and throughout the year details of special regional events are posted here.</mlo:prerequisite>

			<dc:description>If you're thinking about teacher training but would find a traditional full-time course difficult or impossible, the Open University's Professional Graduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) - graded 'outstanding' in recent inspections - could be the answer. Our modular PCGE leads to Qualified Teacher Status in England and Wales, and Eligibility to Teach in Northern Ireland and offers a flexible alternative to conventional university courses. You can study on a part-time or full-time basis, taking up to two years, at a pace to suit your circumstances. You'll study the theory of teaching and learning through supported open learning, which you'll apply in practice during sustained periods of teaching in a partner school, local to where you live. We offer six PGCE subjects at secondary level: design and technology; geography; mathematics; modern foreign languages (French, German and Spanish); music; and science (biology, chemistry and physics). If you're in Scotland, you can study for the Professional Graduate Diploma in Education (V19), currently available only for secondary mathematics.</dc:description>

			<learningOutcome>The Professional Graduate Certificate in Education is a programme of initial teacher education (ITE) that complies with relevant nation-state requirements. It leads directly to Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) conferred by the GTCE in England; QTS conferred by the GTCW in Wales; and 'Eligibility to Teach' conferred by the Department of Education (NI) in Northern Ireland. This PGCE course equips you with the skills, knowledge and understanding to become an effective secondary school teacher. It fosters a reflective approach to classroom teaching - bringing together learning from academic study with the practice learning that takes place during school placements; enabling you to establish links and relationships between them; and encouraging you to reflect on how they shape your learning and professional development. If you live in England, and are considering whether a career in teaching is for you, the Teaching Agency's School Experience Programme (SEP) offers 1 to 10 days' classroom experience in a secondary school. For details, please check the Teaching Agency's Get into Teaching website . If you're a student in higher education in Wales and would like guidance on whether secondary school teaching suits you before applying for a PGCE, we offer a taster course called Prepare to Teach . For details contact Clare Schroder on +44(0) 29 2047 1019 or send her an email . There's more information about how OU study can improve your employability in the OU's Employability Statement from our Careers Advisory Service. You can also read or download our publication OU study and your career and look at our subject pages to find out about career opportunities.</learningOutcome>

Also anyone with a professional interest in sustainable transport, alternative energy, and environmental matters will find the course very relevant.</dc:description>
			<dc:description>Crude oil is currently our most important global source of energy. It is vital in the manufacture of many modern materials. But the world's supply of oil is finite, its price is unstable and our reliance on oil has damaging environmental consequences. Can we sustainably fuel our transport needs with biofuels, electricity or hydrogen? Can we replace the plastics we derive from crude oil with ones made by microorganisms or plants? This introductory module explores oil's vital role in the modern world, as a source of both energy and modern materials, and discusses the issues arising from our dependence on it, assessing some of the exciting scientific developments that could lead to sustainable alternatives to oil.</dc:description>

			<dc:description>Forensic science is rarely out of the news, whether for its triumphs in solving crimes or for questions raised by its use or sometimes misuse. This course looks at the application of this science to topics such as the identification of individuals by the analysis of invisible traces of DNA, the analysis of body fluids in crime detection, and fingerprints and their visualisation. The emphasis is on the use of scientific evidence in the processes and procedures of forensic science from crime scene to court. To study this course you need to have some basic knowledge of chemistry, DNA and genetics.</dc:description>

			<mlo:prerequisite>The course assumes a basic knowledge of chemistry and biology, particularly DNA and genetics. The nature of the subject means that some parts of the course are conceptually fairly demanding, so if you are new to studying at university level you are advised not to take this as your first course. We recommend Molecules, medicines and drugs: a chemical story (SK185) and Human genetics and health issues (SK195) as suitable short courses to study before S187. Alternatively, the science in Exploring science (S104) is excellent preparation. If your science background is limited or 'rusty', revision material will be available on a website but study of it will be outside the time allocated for the course. If you already have some scientific knowledge there is still plenty for you to learn, as forensic science has its own challenges and disciplines. You must be prepared to study some parts of the study book in detail, while other, often more complex, sections will be studied at a superficial level, so you will have to accept that you may not understand in depth all you are reading. This is an important skill that professional scientists have to develop. You should be able to read and understand written English of a style and complexity characteristic of feature length articles and science reports in 'quality' newspapers; you should also be able to communicate your thoughts clearly and comprehensibly in a written format. Mathematically, you need to be able to add, subtract, multiply and divide.

			<mlo:assessment>You must use the online system to submit your end-of-module assessment (EMA). You will have to submit the single piece of written work for assessment after 21 weeks. There will be no other opportunity to complete the course.</mlo:assessment>
			<mlo:prerequisite>The course is designed for people who are coming new to science and to meteorology, and all you really need is an interest in how the weather works and the motivation to find out more about the science underlying meteorological phenomena and forecasting. You must be prepared to study some physical science and to learn how to interpret satellite images, maps, weather charts and graphs. You will need to access various types of forecast through the internet. You must also be willing to make some observations of the weather in your own locality and to keep a record of what you see. Mathematically, you need to be able to add, subtract, multiply and divide, and although it would be useful to have a little basic knowledge of general science this is not essential. The structured teaching will take you to a level at which you will be able to understand important aspects of the science of the atmosphere which give rise to our weather. You should be able to read and understand written English of a style and complexity characteristic of a professional magazine or quality newspaper, and you should be able to communicate your thoughts clearly and comprehensibly in a written format.

			<mlo:prerequisite>This is a Level 2 course and you need to have a good knowledge of the subject area, obtained either through Level 1 study with the OU, or by doing equivalent work at another university. You are expected to have some background knowledge of chemistry, biology, physics and Earth sciences. Our key introductory Level 1 course, Exploring science (S104) would be ideal preparation for this course. It is essential that you establish whether or not your background and experience give you a sound basis on which to tackle the course, since students who are appropriately prepared have the best chance of completing their studies successfully. The Science Faculty has produced some interactive material Are You Ready For S205? to help you to decide whether you already have the recommended background knowledge or experience to start the course, or whether you need extra preparation. This can be viewed as an interactive program for PC or printed as a PDF from the Are you ready for Science? website. Your regional or national centre will also be able to tell you where you can see reference copies of S104. Even if you have some background scientific knowledge, we advise you to read the chemistry in Book 4 of S104.

In these circumstances, you must negotiate with your tutor to get their agreement to submit your assignment on paper. You will, however, be granted the option of submitting on paper if typesetting electronically or merging scanned images of your answers to produce an electronic TMA would take you an unacceptably long time.</mlo:assessment>
			<mlo:prerequisite>This Level 2 course offers a widely accessible route into physics, suitable for students from a range of backgrounds. However, to successfully complete the course you do need some basic scientific and mathematical skills. You should be familiar with basic algebraic manipulation (rearranging and combining equations etc.); addition and multiplication of fractions; scientific notation; logarithms; elementary geometry and trigonometry; vectors; and with scientific uses of statistics and probability. You should also be able to plot and interpret graphs, use a scientific calculator, and understand the use of unit (dimensional) analysis. A familiarity with the elementary concepts of calculus (differentiation) is also an advantage. An appropriate level of mathematical and scientific knowledge can be obtained by studying the Level 1 courses, Maths for science (S151) or Using mathematics (MST121), and Exploring science (S104). It is essential that you establish whether or not your background and experience give you a sound basis on which to tackle the course, since students who are appropriately prepared have the best chance of completing their studies successfully. The Science Faculty has produced a booklet Are You Ready For S207? to help you to decide whether you already have the recommended background knowledge or experience to start the course or whether you first need to study appropriate Level 1 courses. This can be viewed as an interactive program for PC or printed as a PDF from the Are you ready for Science? website.

			<dc:description>This qualification is for you if you work in the area of youth justice. It will deepen your knowledge and critical understanding of the youth justice system in England and Wales; encourage you to reflect on the ideas that influence your work; and develop the understanding and skills you need to move on in your own practice. You'll study the operation of the youth justice system within a multi-agency context; examine the principles of evidence-based practice; and consider the appropriateness of different approaches designed to prevent offending and re-offending by children and young people. You'll provide evidence of competence in putting these methods, values and principles into practice - drawing on your own practice and the operation of the team in which you work. You'll also be able to accurately and discriminately specify, search for and use the information needed for effective practice.</dc:description>

			<mlo:assessment>You will be expected to submit your tutor-marked assignments (TMAs) online through the eTMA system unless there are some difficulties which prevent you from doing so. In these circumstances, you must negotiate with your tutor to get their agreement to submit your assignment on paper. Assessment is an essential part of the teaching, so you are expected to complete it all. Please note that there is an activity related to the completion of the first TMA that you will need to complete by study week 2. If you register late for this course, you should therefore ensure that you read through this assignment as soon as you can.</mlo:assessment>
			<mlo:prerequisite>This is a Level 2 course. You should have the study skills obtained either through Level 1 study with the OU, or by doing equivalent work at another university, and a reasonably sound science background. If you have taken Exploring science (S104) you will be more than adequately prepared, but you are expected to be familiar with only a very limited part of what is covered in S104. If you have not previously taken a Level 1 science course, we advise you to buy The Sciences Good Study Guide by A. Northedge et al . (2003, The Open University). It is essential that you establish whether or not your background and experience give you a sound basis on which to tackle the course, since students who are appropriately prepared have the best chance of completing their studies successfully. The Science Faculty has produced a booklet Are You Ready For S216? to help you to decide whether you already have the recommended background knowledge or experience to start the course or whether you need a little extra preparation. This can be viewed or printed from the Are you ready for Science? website. If you have any doubt about the suitability of the course, please contact our Student Registration &amp; Enquiry Service.</mlo:prerequisite>

			<dc:description>The Earth appears constant and unchanging from a human perspective. Yet over the span of geological time, measured in billions of years, it is a dynamic system in which continents move slowly across its surface; mountain belts rise and fall; ocean basins are created and destroyed; the evolution of life itself occurs and all in concert to the pulse of the Earth's internal energy: heat. But how did all this start? What are the Earth's origins and how does life form part of its pattern? This course tackles these fascinating questions and equips you with the intellectual tools to examine the evidence that is all around us.</dc:description>

			<mlo:prerequisite>This is a Level 2 course and you need to have a good knowledge of the subject area, obtained either through Level 1 study with the OU, or by doing equivalent work at another university. Exploring science (S104) and Maths for science (S151) would be ideal preparation. You are also strongly advised to have already completed Geology (S276) and Planetary science and the search for life (S283) as both are essential preparation for this course. We do not recommend that you start your Level 2 study with this course, as the content requires a familiarity with scientific language and concepts that are reasonably advanced. Although highly rewarding, it is a challenging course as it requires the ability to take a broad overview of an issue, drawing on evidence from a wide range of sources and science disciplines. It will also equip you with the skills and knowledge required to take on any of our current Level 3 Geosciences courses. It is essential that you establish whether or not your background and experience give you a sound basis on which to tackle the course, since students who are appropriately prepared have the best chance of completing their studies successfully.

			<mlo:prerequisite>The course is intended for a wide range of people, so the amount of mathematics is modest: it includes simple algebra and graphs; powers of ten; graphs showing relationships between values of two quantities. Angles measured in both degrees and radians, and the sine and cosine of an angle occur in the text in several places. Several algebraic equations are used, but you have to manipulate only a handful of fairly simple equations. You must be able to put values into algebraic equations to obtain a result, and we give you practice in solving such problems. You do not have to remember lengthy equations and the values of physical constants, as they will be given in the examination paper. You must be competent with a scientific calculator; if you are not, you will need to refer to your calculator manual. With proper preparation, this course is suitable for those who want to develop their understanding of planetary science: anyone who has a general interest; amateur geologists and astronomers; and schoolteachers (at all levels) who want to use the enormous appeal of the subject matter to enhance their teaching of science. You are not expected to have any knowledge of planetary science, but we recommend that you do not attempt this course without a sound knowledge of science from our Level 1 courses. A pass in Exploring science (S104) will provide appropriate science and maths preparation, though if you are not confident in your maths ability then you should also study Maths for science (S151). Using mathematics (MST121) is another option for meeting the maths requirement; this exceeds the level of mathematics required for S283, but you will need to study this course if you are planning to study Level 3 courses in physics and astronomy. It is essential that you establish whether or not your background and experience give you a sound basis on which to tackle the course, since students who are appropriately prepared have the best chance of completing their studies successfully. The Science Faculty has produced a booklet Are You Ready For S283? to help you to decide whether you already have the recommended background knowledge or experience to start the course or whether you need a little extra preparation. This can be viewed or printed from the Are you ready for science? website. If you have any doubt about the suitability of the course, please contact our Student Registration &amp; Enquiry Service.</mlo:prerequisite>

			<dc:description xsi:type="xcriTerms:careerOutcome">This course provides the basic grounding in cell biology appropriate for further training in careers related to biological and biomedical research, biomedical support and laboratory services and health promotion.</dc:description>
			<dc:description>Cell biology explores the fascinating and diverse world of cells, from single-celled micro-organisms to the specialised cells that form complex tissues in plants and animals. It develops the key aspects of cell and molecular biology introduced in Exploring science (S104) and Introducing health sciences: a case study approach (SDK125). The origins of cells and the generation of cell diversity, as well as the common features of cellular structure and function - how they obtain energy, synthesise new molecules, communicate, proliferate and survive - are explored. There is an emphasis on the fundamental importance of cell biology in modern science, particularly in relation to cell technologies and health.</dc:description>

The feedback you receive on your answers will help you to improve your knowledge and understanding of the study material and to develop important skills associated with the course.</mlo:assessment>
			<mlo:prerequisite>This is a Level 2 course and you will need to have study skills appropriate for this level of science study, obtained either by Level 1 study with the OU, or with another Higher Education Institution. You are likely to find parts of this course difficult if you have no knowledge of biology. If you are new to study at a higher education level, we recommend that you study one of our key introductory Level 1 courses - Exploring science (S104) or Introducing health sciences: a case study approach (SDK125) - before this Level 2 course. We strongly recommend that you check whether or not your background and experience are sufficient to give you a sound basis on which to tackle this course, since we have found that students who are appropriately prepared have the best chance of completing their studies successfully and get the most enjoyment out of the course. Our booklet Are you ready for S294? provides more detailed guidance; this can be viewed or printed as a PDF from the Are you ready for science? website. If you are interested in studying this course as part of our foundation degrees in analytical science, please note that entry to these qualifications is restricted to students who are employed in an appropriate setting and are being supported in their practice learning by their employer.

			<dc:description>How do we approach death and dying at an individual level? How do we understand it within a wider social context? What are the ethical dilemmas faced by carers and dying people at the end of life? This certificate introduces a range of issues relating to death, dying and dementia care. Drawing on real case studies and acted scenarios, you'll see and hear from people living with dementia, and from dying people and their carers. You'll learn how people manage grief (including following sudden and mass death); and explore the social context of death and dying, end-of-life care, bereavement, and ethics. You'll also explore the incidence and pathology of dementia and its impact on the person with dementia; how people are cared for at home and in care settings; and the ethical dilemmas associated with dementia. Throughout your studies, the emphasis is on the reality of end-of-life care and what changes can improve that care.</dc:description>

			<mlo:prerequisite>This course will appeal to anyone who is interested in the natural world, particularly those concerned about environmental issues or interested in the idea of the Earth as a system. From a vocational point of view, teachers, mariners, meteorologists and environmentalists will all find the course useful. The most challenging feature is the course's emphasis on the multidisciplinary approach essential to a proper understanding of the marine environment. It is ideal for those who do not like their science cramped by the straitjacket of specialisation. This is a Level 3 course. Level 3 courses build on study skills and subject knowledge acquired from studies at Levels 1 and 2. They are intended only for students who have recent experience of higher education in a related subject, preferably with The Open University. Since this course draws strongly on each of the four main science disciplines - physics, chemistry, biology and Earth sciences - you are strongly advised to obtain a good pass in Environmental science (S216) or at least two Level 2 science courses - preferably in different disciplines - before attempting it. You should also feel comfortable with maths of the standard reached in Exploring science (S104) and Maths for science (S151). It is essential that you establish whether or not your background and experience give you a sound basis on which to tackle the course, since students who are appropriately prepared have the best chance of completing their studies successfully. The Science Faculty has produced a booklet Are You Ready For S330? to help you to decide whether you already have the recommended background knowledge or experience to start the course or whether you need a little extra preparation. This can be viewed or printed from the Are you ready for science? website.

			<dc:description>This course deals with 'chemical change' - on the molecular scale, in the laboratory, in industry, in a car exhaust - or in a complex natural system like the atmosphere. Its underlying aim is to develop an understanding of the factors that guide and control a chemical reaction. The subtle interplay between different aspects of chemical reactivity, and their practical consequences, is especially important in current environmental issues; for example, those relating to industrial chemical production, pollution and energy generation. Apart from the basic cornerstones of thermodynamics and chemical kinetics, topics related to industrial and environmental catalysis, chemical reaction mechanisms and aqueous solution chemistry are covered. Throughout, there is an emphasis on understanding causes and strategies for control in selected environmental applications.</dc:description>

			<dc:description>This course presents the strategy underpinning the design and synthesis of pharmaceutical molecules used to diagnose and treat diseases and illnesses. It focuses on the design of drug molecules, with emphasis on the shape and structure using molecular modelling software. Enzyme and receptor protein targets are examined, together with the mechanisms by which the drugs work. The course explores the array of chemical reactions and strategies for the synthesis of a range of drugs. Case studies including anti-cholesterol and antibiotic drugs illustrate the importance of these strategies in the development of modern medicines.</dc:description>

			<mlo:prerequisite>This is a Level 3 course. Level 3 courses build on study skills and subject knowledge acquired from previous studies at Levels 1 and 2. They are intended only for students who have recent experience of higher education in a related subject, preferably with the OU. You are advised to prepare yourself for this course by taking our key introductory Level 1 course, Exploring science (S104), and at Level 2, The molecular world (S205). These will have covered most of the necessary background. You can get an idea of the level required by looking at the S205 study material. Your regional or national centre will be able to tell you where you can see reference copies, or you can buy selected materials from Open University Worldwide Ltd. It is essential that you establish whether or not your background and experience give you a sound basis on which to tackle the course, since students who are appropriately prepared have the best chance of completing their studies successfully. The Science Faculty has produced a booklet Are You Ready For S346? to help you to decide whether you already have the recommended background knowledge or experience to start the course or whether you need a little extra preparation. This can be viewed or printed from the Are you ready for science ? website.

			<dc:description>Metals play a vital role in the metabolism of plants and animals and, increasingly, in medicine. This course examines the chemistry of the transition metals and outlines the key role they play in living systems, for example in respiration and photosynthesis. It considers how organisms acquire metals, their transport and storage, illustrated by the particular example of iron in the human body. The significant impact of metals in medicine will also be investigated, looking at their role in diagnostic imaging and therapy, as well as the effects of too much metal (metal toxicity) and of metal deficiency.</dc:description>

			<dc:description>This wide-ranging course explains the key concepts of evolutionary science and investigates how these account for the characteristics of living organisms and the history of life on Earth. Using information from the living world and from fossil records, you'll learn how natural selection and other evolutionary processes produce changes in genes and populations over different timescales; how new species originate; and how large-scale evolutionary patterns are generated. Other topics include the reconstruction of evolutionary relationships and the ways in which humans influence the evolution of other species.</dc:description>

			<dc:description>This course explores how we can track environmental change through the geological record. It begins with the sedimentary sequences produced by changes in relative sea level, and the likely role of climatic and tectonic processes in producing these changes. You'll also examine the greenhouse world of the Cretaceous and its tropical/subtropical marine environments; high latitude terrestrial environments; the effect on the environment of large igneous provinces and meteorite impacts; and the mass extinction event at the end of the period. Finally, the course documents the Ice Age, offering possible explanations for the natural climatic changes during the last 2.6 million years.</dc:description>

			<dc:description>Cells are the basic units of life. Cell biology seeks to understand not just the processes that are common to all life forms, but also the ways in which cells control their division and differentiate to form specialised tissues. This course builds from a foundation of molecular biology, with emphasis on animal cell biology. It explores how cells function and considers processes such as cell differentiation, ageing and tumorigenesis. It also develops skills in reading and understanding scientific literature and the handling of experimental data.</dc:description>

			<mlo:prerequisite>This is a Level 3 course. Level 3 courses build on study skills and subject knowledge acquired from previous studies at Levels 1 and 2. They are intended only for students who have recent experience of higher education in a related subject. For the Life Sciences Programme we recommend that you study Exploring science (S104) and Biology: uniformity and diversity (S204) before tackling S377. If you have followed the human science strand of our curriculum (Human biology (SK277) and Biological psychology: exploring the brain (SD226) , or come to S377 from the Molecular Sciences Programme, you will find the course equally relevant and interesting, but more challenging. If this is the case, it is recommended that you have read S204 Book 3, The Core of Life , prior to starting S377 (see Preparatory work below). As a Level 3 course on a rapidly expanding subject, S377 is likely to present a challenge to its students in terms of the amount of information included in the course. The first book in S377 is more 'chemical' while the last three books are more 'biological'. If you're from a chemical background, you may find the biological content of the course demanding, while if you're from a biological background, you may find the groundwork chemistry in Book 1 more challenging. It is thus essential that you establish whether or not your background and experience give you a sound basis on which to tackle the course, since those who are appropriately prepared have the best chance of completing their studies successfully. The Science Faculty has produced a booklet Are You Ready For S377? to help you to decide whether you already have the recommended background knowledge or experience to start the course or whether you need a little extra preparation. This can be viewed as an interactive program for PC or printed as a PDF from the Are you ready for science? website.

This course focuses on the astrophysics of stars and exoplanets - examining their properties, structure, evolution and the physical processes that occur within them. The OU's Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) and internet-based resources are used throughout the course.

			<mlo:assessment>You will be expected to submit your tutor-marked assignments (TMAs) online through the eTMA system unless there are some difficulties which prevent you from doing so. In these circumstances, you must negotiate with your tutor to get their agreement to submit your assignment on paper. You will, however, be granted the option of submitting on paper if typesetting electronically or merging scanned images of your answers to produce an electronic TMA would take you an unacceptably long time. There will be a mixture of online interactive computer-marked assignments (iCMAs) and short tutor-marked assignments (TMAs), with a total workload equivalent of three full TMAs. Both the iCMAs and TMAs will focus strongly on learning through practice rather than on assessment. The feedback you receive on your answers will help you to improve your knowledge and understanding of the study material and to develop important skills associated with the course. The feedback on the iCMAs will be instantaneous and hints will be given so that you can refine any incorrect answers. Although your scores on all these assignments will not contribute directly to your course grade, they form an essential part of the learning process and you will be required to submit a proportion of them to complete the course. Your overall course grade will be based on two examinable components. The first is a portfolio of work comprising your individual Progress Reports and the collaborative group wiki for Part 2 of the module which you submit at the end of this study period. The other is an end-of-module written examination based on Parts 1 and 3.</mlo:assessment>
			<mlo:prerequisite>This is a Level 3 course that builds on study skills and subject knowledge acquired from previous studies at Levels 1 and 2. It is intended for students who have recent experience of higher education in a related subject at this level. The course is designed to follow Astronomy (S282), Planetary science and the search for life (S283), The physical world (S207) and Exploring mathematics (MS221). The following parts of these courses are especially important: * differentiation and integration (MS221) * stellar structure and evolution (S282) * exoplanets (S283) * classical physics of matter (S207). The parts of S282 relating to active galaxies are important as preparation for the SDSS version of the embedded project for this course. If you have studied one of the astronomy activities of Practical science: physics and astronomy (SXP288) you will be better prepared for the PIRATE version. Both versions of the embedded project require considerable use of IT resources, including downloading data from the web, extensive use of spreadsheets and other analysis software, and contributing to wikis and forums. It is essential that you establish whether or not your background and experience give you a sound basis on which to tackle the course, since students who are appropriately prepared have the best chance of completing their studies successfully. The Science Faculty has produced a booklet Are You Ready For S382/S383? to help you to decide whether you already have the recommended background knowledge or experience to start the course or whether you need some extra preparation. This can be viewed or printed from the Are you ready for science? website.

			<mlo:assessment>You will be expected to submit your tutor-marked assignments (TMAs) online through the eTMA system unless there are some difficulties which prevent you from doing so. In these circumstances, you must negotiate with your tutor to get their agreement to submit your assignment on paper. You will, however, be granted the option of submitting on paper if typesetting electronically or merging scanned images of your answers to produce an electronic TMA would take you an unacceptably long time. There will be a mixture of online interactive computer-marked assignments (iCMAs) and short tutor-marked assignments (TMAs), with a total workload equivalent of three full TMAs. Both the iCMAs and TMAs will focus strongly on learning through practice rather than on assessment. The feedback you receive on your answers will help you to improve your knowledge and understanding of the study material and to develop important skills associated with the course. The feedback on the iCMAs will be instantaneous and hints will be given so that you can refine any incorrect answers. Although your scores on all these assignments will not contribute directly to your course grade, they form an essential part of the learning process and you will be required to submit a proportion of them to complete the course. Your overall course grade will be based on two examinable components. The first comprises an extended written assignment for Part 2 of the module which you submit at the end of this study period. The other is an end-of-module written examination based on Parts 1 and 3.</mlo:assessment>
			<mlo:prerequisite>This is a Level 3 course that builds on study skills and subject knowledge acquired from previous studies at Levels 1 and 2. It is intended for students who have recent experience of higher education in a related subject at this level. The course is designed to follow Astronomy (S282), The physical world (S207) and Mathematical methods and models (MST209). The parts of MST209 relating to ordinary and partial differential equations and matrices, the parts of S282 relating to galaxies and cosmology, and the parts of S207 relating to special relativity are especially important. It is essential that you establish whether or not your background and experience give you a sound basis on which to tackle the course, since students who are appropriately prepared have the best chance of completing their studies successfully. The Science Faculty has produced a booklet Are You Ready For S382/S383? to help you to decide whether you already have the recommended background knowledge or experience to start the course or whether you need some extra preparation. This can be viewed or printed from the Are you ready for science? website.

			<dc:description>This course considers the interactions between organisms and their environment that together form an ecosystem - which can range from a simple microbial community to the biodiverse rainforests of the tropics. Even the Earth as a whole may be considered an ecosystem. You'll develop your understanding of the terrestrial environment as a habitat for a vast array of different organisms; the connections between them and their surroundings; and their resilience to anthropogenic changes - such as pollution and climate change. You'll also gain practical experience in ecosystem science - making observations in your locality, and through extensive use of models to investigate processes essential to supporting life on Earth.</dc:description>

			<mlo:assessment>You must use the online eTMA system to submit your tutor-marked assignments (TMAs). Assessment is an essential part of the teaching, so you are expected to complete it all. Please note that the substitution rule does not apply to this course. Please note that there is a practical task related to the completion of the first TMA that you will need to start in the first study week. You should bear this in mind, especially if you register late for this course.</mlo:assessment>
			<mlo:prerequisite>This is a Level 3 course. Level 3 courses build on study skills and subject knowledge acquired from studies at Levels 1 and 2. They are intended for students who have recent experience of higher education in a related subject, preferably with the OU. You will be required to interpret fairly complex graphs, and to manipulate datasets in spreadsheets to create your own graphs and perform simple statistical tests (e.g. linear regression). During the course you will use bespoke spreadsheets to analyse datasets using the ANOVA, regression, and multiple regression statistical tests. So, if you are unfamiliar with spreadsheet operations, you are strongly advised to gain experience prior to starting the course. You will also carry out some practical investigations - some field-related - involving measurement and analysis of the results using statistics. It is very important that you have a basic understanding of certain statistical tests before you study this course (for example, the Spearman Rank Correlation test and the t-test). Further details are given in the Are You Ready For S396? booklet mentioned below. You will therefore need a background in science, such as you would get from our Level 1 science course Exploring Science (S104). The preferred route would be to take the Level 2 science course Environmental science (S216) before embarking on S396. Your regional or national centre will be able to tell you where you can see reference copies of the courses mentioned here. It is essential that you establish whether or not your background and experience give you a sound basis from which to tackle the course, since students who are appropriately prepared have the best chance of completing their studies successfully. The Science Faculty has produced a booklet Are You Ready For S396? to help you to decide whether you already have the recommended background knowledge or experience to start the course or whether you need a little extra preparation. This can be viewed or printed from the Are you ready for science? website. If you have any doubt about the suitability of the course, please contact our Student Registration &amp; Enquiry Service.</mlo:prerequisite>

			<dc:description>Modern Earth science is the study of the Earth as a complex system of interacting reservoirs including the geosphere (core, mantle and crust), and the superficial reservoirs, including the hydrosphere, cryosphere and atmosphere. The resulting Earth system produces slowly changing stable habitats for life - the same Earth system produces sudden and catastrophic environmental changes. This online course explores several of the most important Earth system interactions through physical observations in the modern world, geological observations, measurements of changing chemical signatures, and quantitative and semi-quantitative models. Understanding past global changes helps to understand and predict the likely outcomes of present-day Earth.</dc:description>

			<dc:description>What do biologists and psychologists understand by the concepts of brain and consciousness? How do we study the brain, its structure and development? What is schizophrenia? This course presents an integrated, interdisciplinary approach to the brain and to the behavioural and psychological sciences. It focuses on humans, and where possible considers implications for human health of factors affecting behaviour and the nervous system. Much of our understanding of the nervous system derives from animal research, so this is also described. The emphasis is on observation and experiment, and you'll carry out some investigations yourself.</dc:description>

			<mlo:prerequisite>This is a Level 2 course and to study it successfully you need to have the study skills needed for both higher education and distance learning, obtained either through Level 1 study with the OU, or by doing equivalent work at another university. We strongly advise you to study one of our key introductory Level 1 courses, such as Exploring science (S104) or Introducing the social sciences (DD101) before progressing to Level 2 study. As this is an interdisciplinary course, it is likely to present a challenge to all its students. The first half of the course is more 'biological' while the second half is more 'psychological'. Students from a non-science background may find the biological content of the course demanding, while those from a science background may find the psychological approach unfamiliar. It is not essential to have a scientific background to study this course, although clearly some knowledge of basic biology would be very useful. You are also strongly recommended not to start your Level 2 study with this course. It would be helpful to have studied another Level 2 course first such as Exploring psychology (DSE212), Child development (ED209), Human biology (SK277) or Biology: uniformity and diversity (S204). It is essential that you establish whether or not your background and experience give you a sound basis on which to tackle the course, since students who are appropriately prepared have the best chance of completing their studies successfully. The Science Faculty has produced a booklet Are You Ready For SD226? to help you to decide whether you already have the recommended background knowledge or experience to start the course or whether you need a little extra preparation. This can be viewed as an interactive program for PC or printed as a PDF from the Science Faculty website . If you have any doubt about the suitability of the course, please contact our Student Registration &amp; Enquiry Service.</mlo:prerequisite>

			<dc:description>This interdisciplinary course uses fundamental concepts from biology, chemistry, physics and psychology to explain how we interact with our environment through the five senses - hearing, sight, smell, taste and the somatic sensory system, which includes touch and pain. For each of the senses you'll investigate how sensation begins with a stimulus that is converted into an electrochemical impulse; how that is transmitted to the brain; and how the brain combines these messages - the process psychologists call 'perception'. The course is designed to be accessible to students pursuing a wide variety of degree studies.</dc:description>

			<mlo:prerequisite>This is a key introductory Level 1 course. Level 1 courses provide core subject knowledge and study skills needed for both higher education and distance learning, to help you to progress to Level 2 study. SDK125 is for students who are new to science, as well as those with some background in a science-related subject. Although you're not expected to have any previous knowledge of science, you should be able to add, subtract, multiply and divide simple whole numbers, and to understand written English of the standard of a broadsheet newspaper ( The Daily Telegraph or The Guardian , for example). If you haven't studied science or maths up to GCSE level fairly recently, or you're new to using a computer to access online or DVD-based resources, you should expect to spend longer on the study materials. Our Student Registration &amp; Enquiry Service will be able to discuss with you how much extra time you are likely to need and whether you should consider doing some preparatory study before beginning SDK125. If you are new or a less confident learner, start with Understanding health (Y178). This is an Openings course, also at Level 1 but worth 15 credits. Designed with lots of support and no examination, it will give you a gentle introduction to this subject and to OU study. If you successfully complete this Openings course, you'll be ready to study SDK125. Alternatively our package Are you ready for science study? offers an interactive quiz to help you decide whether you already have the recommended background knowledge or experience to start the course or whether you should consider first studying an Openings course. Introducing health sciences: a case study approach will help to prepare you for Exploring science (S104) and Level 2 health sciences courses (for example, Human biology (SK277) or Biological psychology: exploring the brain (SD226)). By the end of the course you will be expected to be working successfully at the level required of first-year undergraduate students. If you have any doubt about the suitability of the course, please contact our Student Registration &amp; Enquiry Service.</mlo:prerequisite>

			<dc:description>This course gives an overview of two medical conditions that present a major global health problem; cardiovascular disease and cancer. Many of us will encounter these medical conditions either through professional involvement in health, or through affected family members or friends. Your study of cardiovascular diseases will develop your understanding of heart and circulatory diseases, and the anatomy and physiology of the cardiovascular system. Cancers result from defects in cell proliferation, so you'll study the properties of cells, how they divide and how tumours are formed and spread. Both topics consider risk factors and methods of detection, treatment and prevention worldwide.</dc:description>

			<dc:description>Are we really what we eat? What is the link between food and our health and wellbeing? Understanding human nutrition will provide you with information about the components of the human diet, and how food is processed in the body. It enables you to apply this information to understand the links between nutrition and health for people of all ages and a range of lifestyles. After an introduction to nutrition and food, the course deals with the chemistry of the main nutrient types - proteins, fats, carbohydrates, vitamins and minerals - and their importance in diet, and energy intake and output. The final part of the course applies this knowledge to the diet of different groups such as children, adults, and the elderly, and makes links between diet and health issues.</dc:description>

			<mlo:assessment>You must use the online system to submit your end-of-module assessment (EMA). You have to submit the single piece of written work for assessment after 21 weeks. There will be no other opportunity to complete the course.</mlo:assessment>
			<mlo:prerequisite>Although the course does not assume any previous scientific background, during it you will be introduced to the chemical structure of some of the molecules in food so a basic knowledge of chemistry would be useful, as would some basic biology. However, for much of the course you need little more than an interest in nutrition and the motivation to understand more of the science behind it. You should be able to read and understand written English of a style and complexity characteristic of a professional magazine or quality newspaper, and you should be able to communicate your thoughts clearly and comprehensibly in a written format. Mathematically you need only to be able to add, subtract, multiply and divide simple numbers. A maths skills ebook is provided to help you with, for example, fractions, percentages, reading graphs and tables, and scientific units as required by the course. You can check that you have the appropriate background by trying out the interactive quiz Are you ready for science study?

			<dc:description>From Hippocrates to modern times, society has sought ways of relieving pain and curing or preventing disease. From ancient wisdom to herbal remedies, there have been important discoveries resulting in the development of medicines that are commonplace today. Modern research at the molecular level constantly adds to the range of drugs available to combat ill-health. This course tells the fascinating story of the development of a variety of drugs and explores chemical strategies to minimise the risk of infection and disease.</dc:description>

			<dc:description>This course deals with a subject of importance to us all - our genes, which is an area at the forefront of developments in medical science. Our characters, including our appearance, depend on the functions of genes. Genes also contribute to a person's behaviour and health. The course examines: the patterns of inheritance of genes, including those associated with genetic diseases; the sequence and content of the human genome; how genes function; how the physical and biochemical characteristics of the body are produced; and why there are differences between individuals and between populations. Finally, it explores some of the issues surrounding research into genes, from biological, medical and ethical points of view.</dc:description>

			<dc:description>This course presents human biology in a way that connects it directly with health and disease. It starts with the concept of a healthy body and explores the mechanisms that enable it to maintain its integrity. Although you'll deal with the physiology of each body system separately, the overall emphasis is on interaction and coordination. You'll acquire sufficient background to appreciate how systems can fail and which medical interventions can be successful. The course will suit science students - especially those with a biology background; anyone interested in health; or people working in health and social care or other professions allied to medicine.</dc:description>

In these circumstances, you must negotiate with your tutor to get their agreement to submit your assignment on paper.</mlo:assessment>
			<mlo:prerequisite>This is a Level 2 course. It would be an advantage to have studied biology or human biology to GCSE or, preferably, A-level standard. In addition, you are expected to have the study skills appropriate to progress on a Level 2 course, and these can be acquired through achieving a pass in one of the University's Level 1 courses; we particularly recommend Introducing health sciences: a case study approach (SDK125) or Exploring science (S104), or An introduction to health and social care (K101). As well as being a suitable choice for science students, especially those who have a background in biology and health, the course can also provide a sound grounding in human physiology for social-science students who are particularly interested in health. It is very appropriate for health and social-care workers, and particularly for people in professions allied to medicine. If you have not taken our Level 1 course Exploring Science (S104), or Introducing health sciences: a case study approach (SDK125), SK277 can serve as a refresher course, perhaps for nurses returning to work or others who want to update their knowledge. If you have any doubt about the suitability of the course, please contact our Student Registration &amp; Enquiry Service.</mlo:prerequisite>

			<dc:description>Infectious disease affects all our lives to varying degrees, often making front-page news: 'New resistant strain of TB', 'Will bird flu cross over to humans?' 'Hospital infections reach epidemic proportions', etc. This course approaches infectious disease from several perspectives - exploring the underlying biology, epidemiology, ecology and evolution of pathogens in relation to the extraordinary immune defences of their human hosts. You will learn how infections are diagnosed, how to study changes in the incidence of diseases and investigate strategies for treatment and control through detailed case studies. You will also have the chance to study a disease or disease-related topic in detail.</dc:description>

			<dc:description>If you're interested in the fundamental laws of modern physics and how mathematics is used to state and apply these laws, this course is for you. It surveys the physical principles, mathematical techniques and interpretation of quantum theory. The Schrodinger equation, the uncertainty principle, the exclusion principle, fermions and bosons, measurement probabilities, entanglement, perturbation theory and transition rates are all discussed. Applications include atoms, molecules, nuclei, solids, scanning tunnelling microscopy and quantum cryptography. The course also presents recent evidence relating to some of the most surprising and non-classical predictions of quantum mechanics.</dc:description>

			<mlo:assessment>You will be expected to submit your tutor-marked assignments (TMAs) online through the eTMA system unless there are some difficulties which prevent you from doing so. In these circumstances, you must negotiate with your tutor to get their agreement to submit your assignment on paper. You will, however, be granted the option of submitting on paper if typesetting electronically or merging scanned images of your answers to produce an electronic TMA would take you an unacceptably long time. There will be a mixture of online interactive computer-marked assignments (iCMAs) and short tutor-marked assignments (TMAs), with a total workload equivalent of three full TMAs. Both the iCMAs and TMAs will focus strongly on learning through practice rather than on assessment. The feedback you receive on your answers will help you to improve your knowledge and understanding of the study material and to develop important skills associated with the course. The feedback on the iCMAs will be instantaneous and hints will be given so that you can refine any incorrect answers. Although your scores on all these assignments will not contribute directly to your course grade, they form an essential part of the learning process and you will be required to submit a proportion of them to complete the course. You will be given detailed information when you start the course.</mlo:assessment>
			<learningOutcome>In this course, you will learn the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics and the mathematical techniques needed to state and apply them. You will explore the interpretation of quantum mechanics and critically evaluate the extent to which quantum mechanics has been tested by experiment. You will also see how quantum mechanical methods are used to model phenomena in physical systems including atoms, molecules and solids.</learningOutcome>
			<mlo:prerequisite>This is a Level 3 course that builds on study skills and subject knowledge acquired from previous studies at Levels 1 and 2. It is intended for students who have recent experience of higher education in a related subject at this level. The course is designed to follow Mathematical methods and models (MST209) and The physical world (S207). You would find it very difficult to study SM358 without the necessary mathematical background. The parts of MST209 relating to ordinary and partial differential equations, matrices and angular momentum are especially important. S207 is the ideal physics course to prepare you for studying SM358, particularly the parts relating to classical and quantum mechanics. Students are most successful if they have acquired their prerequisite knowledge through passing these two Level 2 courses. It is essential that you establish whether or not your background and experience give you a sound basis on which to tackle SM358. The Science Faculty has produced a booklet Are You Ready For SM358? To help you decide whether you already have the recommended background knowledge and experience to start the course or whether you need some extra preparation.

			<dc:description>This course is concerned with the electromagnetic fields and electromagnetic radiation that pervade the world around you. It shows how the main ideas of electromagnetism can be encapsulated in the famous Maxwell's equations. These can be used to explain the properties of light and radiowaves; the magnetic fields produced by brain activity; the way a television tube works; the transparency of the cornea in your eye; and many other phenomena. If you're interested in the ways that physics and mathematics are used to understand the world around you, then this would be an appropriate course to study.</dc:description>

			<dc:description>Electromagnetism is central to our understanding of the physical world and to modern technology. This residential school features experiments that develop your understanding of electromagnetic concepts, showing how our knowledge is based on observations. You'll also investigate modern applications, and use computers both to simulate the motion of charged particles in magnetic fields and to solve Laplace's equation. The one-week school will be held at The University of Sussex, with a choice of dates in July and/or August. Register early if you have a preference, as unfortunately we can't always offer your first choice of date and venue.</dc:description>

			<mlo:assessment>There will be a computer-marked assignment (CMA) before the residential week, and a written assignment, submitted on paper, at the end of the course. To pass the course you must pass this assessment, as well as participate satisfactorily in all the experimental sessions at the school.</mlo:assessment>
			<mlo:prerequisite>This residential school supports and complements the 30-credit course Electromagnetism (SMT359), and students taking that are advised to take the residential school course in the same year if possible. It is also appropriate if you are taking physics, other science or engineering courses, either with The Open University or elsewhere, and you would like a course based on experiments and computer simulations in electromagnetism. This is a Level 3 course. Level 3 courses build on study skills and subject knowledge acquired from studies at Levels 1 and 2. They are intended only for students who have recent experience of higher education in a related subject, usually with the OU. The associated course SMT359 requires a good pass in an applied mathematics course at the level of Mathematical methods and models (MST209), as well as a physics background such as from The physical world (S207) . This mathematics and physics background is also essential for SMXR359, but in addition you must have further knowledge equivalent to the first half of SMT359. It is also desirable for you to have taken the residential-school course Physics by experiment (SXR207) (now discontinued), which provides essential preparation for carrying out and recording physics experiments. It is essential that you establish whether or not your background and experience give you a sound basis on which to tackle the course, since students who are appropriately prepared have the best chance of completing their studies successfully. The Science Faculty has produced a booklet Are You Ready For SMXR359? to help you to decide whether you already have the recommended background knowledge or experience to start the course or whether you need a little extra preparation. This can be viewed or printed from the Science Faculty website .

			<dc:description xsi:type="xcriTerms:careerOutcome">The course will be of particular relevance if you are working in the energy supply industry and in particular the nuclear industry. If you have a professional interest in nuclear energy, environmental matters and global warming you will also find this course very relevant.</dc:description>
			<dc:description>Nuclear energy is back in the news as governments around the world increasingly commit to building new nuclear reactors. This course looks at the motivations driving this new commitment, and considers the development and history of nuclear energy as well as the difficult issues around safety and nuclear waste disposal. The underlying science, the technology, the biological effects of radiation and the costs of producing electricity are all examined in such a way as to help explain why nuclear energy seems so certain to form a part of our energy future.</dc:description>

			<mlo:assessment>You must use the online eTMA system to submit your end-of-module assessment (EMA). You have to submit the single piece of written work for assessment after 21 weeks. There will be no other opportunity to complete the course.</mlo:assessment>
			<mlo:prerequisite>In this course you will meet a wide range of scientific and technological subjects and will have to be prepared to understand some basic science, e.g. physics, biology, chemistry and geology. While it is designed for people who are new to these subject areas, you will probably find that you can move faster through the study materials if you have a little basic knowledge of general science. However all you really need is an interest in the issues involved in nuclear energy and learning more about the science behind it. If you have read popular books and magazines on the subject, you will find that the course develops your understanding and introduces topics that you have not met before. Mathematically, you should be able to add, subtract, multiply and divide positive and negative numbers and understand the use of brackets in numerical calculations. You will meet numbers expressed as fractions, decimals and using simple powers (e.g. 10 3 for 1000). The structured teaching will take you to a level at which you are happy to use maths as a tool in a range of scientific contexts. A maths skills ebook is provided to help you with, for example, fractions, percentages, reading graphs and tables, and scientific units as required. You should be able to read and understand written English of a style and complexity characteristic of a professional magazine or quality newspaper, and you should be able to communicate your thoughts clearly and comprehensibly in a written format. If you have any doubt about the suitability of the course, please contact our Student Registration &amp; Enquiry Service.</mlo:prerequisite>

			<dc:description>This course is the project module for the BSc (Hons) Environmental Science. You will undertake an independent practical investigation of a topic within the area of Environmental Science. You will design your investigation, collect data (this may be in the field, in a laboratory or at home), analyse it and produce a scientific report. The study materials provide a guide to planning and conducting project work; help with searching and using the literature; and writing a report, but ultimately this is a chance for you to plan and execute a piece of work for yourself.</dc:description>

In these circumstances, you must negotiate with your tutor to get their agreement to submit your assignment on paper. The TMAs help you to record your progress with the investigation and build up the elements required for the project report. The project is a rigorous piece of science writing and comprises a substantial part of the examinable component. You will be expected to keep a log of your project work and to submit your cumulative log with your TMAs and with the examinable component.</mlo:assessment>
			<mlo:prerequisite>This is a Level 3 course. Level 3 courses build on study skills and subject knowledge acquired from previous studies at Levels 1 and 2. They are intended only for students who have recent experience of higher education in a related subject. You should study this project course as the final module of the BSc (Hons) Environmental Sciences, as you will need to apply knowledge and skills from your prior studies. Normally you should have gained at least 60 credits of the Level 3 requirements for your degree before starting your project course. It is essential that you establish whether or not your background and experience give you a sound basis on which to tackle the course, since students who are appropriately prepared have the best chance of completing their studies successfully. The Science Faculty has produced a booklet Are You Ready For your Science Level 3 Project Course? to help you to decide whether you already have the recommended background knowledge or experience to start the course or whether you need a little extra preparation.

There is also a Physics Education Research topic. You'll need access to scientific literature, probably from electronic library sources. The study materials provide a guide to planning and conducting project work; help with searching and using the literature; and writing a report, but ultimately this is a chance for you to plan and execute a piece of work for yourself.</dc:description>

			<mlo:assessment>You will be expected to submit your tutor-marked assignments (TMAs) online through the eTMA system unless there are some difficulties which prevent you from doing so. In these circumstances, you must negotiate with your tutor to get their agreement to submit your assignment on paper. The end-of-module assessment (EMA) must be submitted online. The TMAs help you to record progress with your investigation and build up the elements required for the project report. The project is a serious piece of science writing and comprises a substantial part of the examinable component. You will be expected to keep a log of your project work and to submit your cumulative log with your TMAs and with the examinable component.</mlo:assessment>
			<mlo:prerequisite>This is a Level 3 course. Level 3 courses build on study skills and subject knowledge acquired from previous studies at Levels 1 and 2. They are intended only for students who have recent experience of education in a related subject. You should study this science project course as the final module of the BSc (Hons) Natural Sciences, as you will need to apply knowledge and skills from your prior studies. Normally you should have passed at least 60 credits of the Level 3 requirements for your degree, before embarking on your project course. It is essential that you establish whether or not your background and experience give you a sound basis on which to tackle the course, since students who are appropriately prepared have the best chance of completing their studies successfully. The Science Faculty has produced a booklet Are You Ready For Your Science Level 3 Project Course? to help you to decide whether you already have the recommended background knowledge or experience to start the course or whether you need a little extra preparation. This can be viewed or printed from the Science Faculty website . If you have any doubt about the suitability of the course, please contact our Student Registration &amp; Enquiry Service.</mlo:prerequisite>

			<dc:description>The Scottish Highlands are the roots of a once much larger mountain range formed more than 400 million years ago. At this six-day residential school, you'll study the field evidence for the growth and demise of this ancient mountain range - gaining the practical fieldwork and complementary laboratory experience needed for a qualification specialising in Earth sciences. In particular, you'll study igneous, metamorphic and structurally complex rocks in their natural settings. The school is held in Scotland, with a choice of dates in July and August - register early if you have a preference, as unfortunately we can't always offer your first choice.</dc:description>

			<dc:description>Are you interested in what shapes the lives we lead and the decisions we make? Have you wondered why people continue to smoke when they know the risks, or why governments want to reorganise the NHS? Social scientists build theories and conduct research to understand why and how people, groups and institutions respond to change, exercise power and make decisions. The Certificate of Higher Education in Social Sciences provides a compelling introduction to social science approaches, and a springboard to further study. You'll gain fascinating insights into everyday life in our communities, personal lives and workplaces, drawing on ideas from sociology, economics, social policy, psychology, geography, criminology, and politics. This certificate course will also develop a range of skills centering on the effective use of analysis and written argument that will be valuable at work and in your personal life. You'll have your own specialist, subject-based academic support as well as opportunities to join in online communities of other social sciences students for teaching, learning and peer support.</dc:description>

			<dc:description>The myth of Linux is based on the misconception that it's a difficult operating system to understand, hard to use and has many issues surrounding its quality. As one of the most extensively used operating systems worldwide, the chances are that the website you last visited was running on a Linux-supported system. In this ten-week online course - designed for absolute beginners - you'll examine the many similarities that exist between Linux and operating systems such as Microsoft Windows. You'll also explore the diverse technology available in the Linux community.

			<mlo:assessment>You must use the online eTMA system to submit your end-of-module assessment (EMA). For the EMA you will choose from a selection of briefs, and make and publish a short video that demonstrates your knowledge, understanding and skills. An accompanying piece of written work will assess your ability to articulate how you have applied your creative, organisational and technical abilities to your video.</mlo:assessment>
			<learningOutcome>Film-making involves bringing many elements together as a whole. The course will help you develop your knowledge and skills in three key areas: Creativity - The elements that make a satisfying visual narrative and how media is constructed in terms of genre, shot types, sequencing, soundtrack and composition. How to combine images and audio to communicate specific information accurately and appropriately for a given purpose and audience. Organising - Managing the production process for creating media to a brief, including issues such as planning, media rights, choice of equipment, and scheduling. The key to this area is working well with other people, communicating clearly and building effective relationships. Technical - Considerations such as editing techniques, media formats, how to set up and get the most from your equipment, and getting your work into the right form for sharing. Strategies for researching online to find, select and use relevant information on techniques and technical matters, and to present it to others.</learningOutcome>
			<mlo:prerequisite>This is a Level 1 course. Level 1 courses provide core subject knowledge and study skills needed for both higher education and distance learning, to help you progress to courses at Level 2. You do not require any previous qualification or prior knowledge of film-making or the use of video to study this course, but you will need some experience of using the internet and a basic proficiency in computing. You will be familiar with some of the teaching concepts in this course if you have studied Digital photography: creating and sharing better images (T189), but this is not a requirement. Whether you want to simply capture memorable moments, use video in your career, or enjoy the team spirit and creativity of low-budget film-making, the study material is designed to help you start your journey.

			<dc:description>From design concepts to the manufacture of products, this key introductory Level 1 course examines the range of human activity that is 'engineering'. It introduces the context in which engineers operate - including issues such as product safety and patent law - and looks at current engineering practice. It considers some of the developments in engineering methods and applications that will shape the future. The course is ideal as a general introduction if you simply have an interest in what engineering is and how it is practised in modern society; and also if you're considering studying engineering at higher levels and wish to acquire more specialised skills.</dc:description>

			<mlo:assessment>You will be expected to submit your tutor-marked assignments (TMAs) online through the eTMA system unless there are some difficulties which prevent you from doing so. In these circumstances, you must negotiate with your tutor to get their agreement to submit your assignment on paper. Assessment is an essential part of the teaching, so you are expected to complete it all. But if you unavoidably miss or perform badly in an assignment, some courses allow you a 'substitution score'. In T173 this rule can apply to one assignment only. You will be given more detailed information when you begin the course.</mlo:assessment>
			<mlo:prerequisite>This is a key introductory Level 1 course. Level 1 courses provide core subject knowledge and study skills needed for both higher education and distance learning, to help you to progress to courses at Level 2. You are not expected to have any particular scientific or technical knowledge, but you should be able to solve simple mathematical problems; read and understand written English of a style and complexity characteristic of a professional magazine or quality newspaper; and interpret simple maps, plans, line graphs and tabulated data. If you are new or a less confident learner, start with Introducing environment (Y181) or Starting with maths (Y182). These are Openings courses, also at Level 1 but worth 15 credits. Designed with lots of support and no examination, they will give you a gentle introduction to this subject and to OU study. If you successfully complete one of these Openings courses, you'll be ready to study T173. If you have any doubt about the suitability of the course, please contact our Student Registration &amp; Enquiry Service.</mlo:prerequisite>

			<dc:description>This ten-week online course shows how design principles can be applied to the creation of web pages and websites. It explores the elements of web page design, text, colour, images, and assembling them as layout. The course also covers usability issues such as navigation, access, interactivity, and designing virtual experiences. Creating your own website can be great fun - you'll publish a website within a week of starting the course. You'll use a web page editor, which we explain how to use in detail. Tuition is via an online forum; here you can seek help and advice, and exchange opinions with fellow students.</dc:description>

			<dc:description>Taking an innovative approach, this course teaches and evaluates your general and key skills associated with lifelong learning and career management. You will examine your career position, your qualifications and your learning needs, before compiling a development plan. Depending on your aspirations, you'll identify a profile of modules to satisfy the OU regulations for the award of a BEng (Hons) degree. If you also have one of the grades of membership of a professional engineering institution as your target, leading to IEng or CEng, your profile will aim to satisfy the educational requirements of the institution you've selected. You must first satisfactorily complete this course if you intend to take Key skills for professional engineers (T397) .</dc:description>

			<dc:description>How can we provide clean, safe, environmentally-sustainable energy supplies for Britain, Europe and the world as a whole during the twenty-first century, despite rising population and increasing affluence? You will study the sustainability problems of our conventional fossil and nuclear fuel use, and how they might be relieved; explore the technological and social possibilities for using energy much more efficiently; and investigate various renewable-energy sources (such as solar, wind and biofuels) that significantly reduce effects on the environment. In the course project, you research and write a sustainable energy proposal for your own home, workplace, or community.</dc:description>

			<dc:description>Engineering is about extending society's horizons by solving technical problems - from meeting basic needs for food and shelter to generating wealth by trade. Engineers prefer to see difficulties as challenges or opportunities - they appear to be solving problems, but they're actually creating solutions: an altogether more imaginative activity. In exploring how technical solutions are created, this course combines the mechanics of solids and fluids with the structure and properties of materials. It includes aspects of engineering analysis, design, and modelling methods, using appropriate mathematical software. Analytical, communication, and learning skills are developed in a context that provides grounding for higher-level, more specialised study.</dc:description>

			<dc:description>People encounter designed products every day, from bus tickets to buildings. We travel on, wear and even eat products that have been designed. This course introduces the products and practices of contemporary design. You'll learn about the processes that generate products, practise basic design skills, and discover what being a designer involves - exploring mass market production like music players and kitchen gadgets, and more specialist contributions such as a Formula One car, solar-heated building or unique wedding dress. If you're already a practising designer, the course will develop your understanding of design principles - enabling you to see and compare their application in various fields.</dc:description>

			<mlo:prerequisite>This is a Level 2 course. We have designed it to be accessible and of interest to students of arts, social sciences, business studies and education as well as to those taking courses in science or technology. If you are studying materials, mechanics or electronics, you will benefit from gaining a design perspective; if you are already a designer, the course will broaden your experience and show the relationships between design principles and practices. Beyond basic literacy skills, nothing more specific is expected other than a curiosity about objects, why they are as they are, and how they might be different and better. We do not assume that you can already design, or even draw competently. You will be taught all the concepts and skills that you need, but if you already have some skills you will be able to develop them further.

			<mlo:prerequisite>This 60-credit course is studied over nine months. Please be aware that you will need to spend 16-20 hours per week studying this course over the nine-month period. This is a Level 2 course, but no skill or knowledge in this area is assumed. Basic numeracy is expected. Because all of the study material is online, you should be confident in the use of a computer to access the web, and you should be prepared to spend most of your study time online. Broadband access is essential. The study material contains active content, which means that you will need to set up your firewall to allow pop-ups from the Cisco and OU sites. The study material is provided by Cisco; see their website for an example. Cisco amongst other industry leaders promotes diversity in their workforce and are working with The Open University to support women entrants into the CCNA program.

			<dc:description>This course explores strategies for analysing, defining and controlling environmental pollution. Its main themes are drinking water supply, air quality management, noise control and solid waste. The course builds on Environmental control and public health (T210) (now discontinued). You'll also need strong numeracy skills, a good knowledge of chemistry, and the ability to develop and use computer models. The course considers water treatment processes, demand and quality; atmospheric pollution dispersal, modelling and control; noise prediction schemes and sound insulation; and the development of local waste management strategies. A final environmental impact assessment project brings these topics together.</dc:description>

			<mlo:prerequisite>This course has been designed for both practising and would-be environmental professionals in land, air, water and noise pollution. You need a thorough working knowledge of basic chemistry and mathematics and some familiarity with computing. We strongly recommend that you take the Open University course Environmental control and public health (T210) (now discontinued) before you take this course, and you will benefit from taking T308 as soon as possible after T210. You should be able to interpret graphs, manipulate equations, understand logarithms and operate a scientific calculator. You must be able to understand chemical equations and nomenclature, and to solve quantitative problems involving heat and mass calculations. If you have not taken T210, you need to have experience of quantitative approaches to environmental pollution control and the problems affecting land, air, water and noise. In particular, you should be able to: define, describe and assess pollution describe the diversity of plant and animal life and the role of certain groups of living organisms in pollution control techniques list the biological, chemical and physical characteristics of rivers and lakes and how pollutants affect the aquatic environment list and describe the processes of water purification and sewage treatment list and describe the processes used in managing municipal solid waste and hazardous wastes in order to minimise their detrimental effects recognise and use terms related to the basic physics of sound, and list the principles and describe the practice of noise control give brief accounts of the effects of air pollutants describe and select appropriate techniques to quantify and eliminate air pollutants. T210 covers all these topics. T308 is a Level 3 course, which makes intellectual demands appropriate to the final year of an honours degree.

The end-of-module assessment (EMA) is an individual project, which must also be submitted electronically. The project will account for approximately a third of your study time on this course. Each assessment component (TMA and project) consists of practical work and a written report, with the exception of the first TMA which is made up entirely of a written report.</mlo:assessment>
			<mlo:prerequisite>This is a Level 3 course. Level 3 courses build on study skills and subject knowledge acquired from studies at Levels 1 and 2. They are intended only for students who have recent experience of higher education in a related subject, preferably with the OU. You need a familiarity with communication technology, and language and modelling techniques used by technologists, such as you would get from appropriate courses at Level 2 offered by the Faculty of Mathematics, Computing and Technology, or their equivalent. Communication and information technologies (T215) would be particularly useful. Alternatively, an understanding of computer networks and network protocols (e.g. TCP/IP), and an awareness of security issues would provide appropriate relevant background knowledge. You should be experienced in using a computer for working with documents, spreadsheets and accessing the World Wide Web. You also need good writing and basic mathematical skills so that you can produce a well-structured report and work with basic algebraic equations and carry out numerical calculations.

			<dc:description>Keeping ahead in information and communication technologies (ICT) not only means keeping up to date with rapidly changing technologies. It also means successfully using these new technologies in complex systems in which people play a major part. Therefore this course addresses the two important questions: How do you keep up to date and how can you analyse ICT systems and take account of social factors? This course will equip you with the skills to tackle these questions, in the context of studying several contemporary ICT systems. By the end, you should be well-placed as an independent learner to 'keep ahead in ICT'.</dc:description>

			<dc:description>This course is the compulsory project module of the BEng (Hons). It gives you an opportunity to demonstrate the knowledge and skills you have already acquired in your Level 3 engineering studies, by completing an individual engineering project. You'll choose the theme from a selection of broad project headings: electronic materials, engineering small worlds, environmental monitoring, fluid mechanics, innovation and design, managing complexity, materials failure, radio frequency engineering, solid mechanics and structural integrity. You'll develop the project topic, execute it and then write it up. A tutor will advise and guide you, but you'll be expected to produce your work independently, without close supervision.</dc:description>

			<dc:description>This research course builds on your existing postgraduate diploma to enable you to complete your MSc. You'll design a research proposal by identifying and developing a research problem relevant to your MSc. You will undertake primary (original data collection) and secondary (literature review) research, analyse this data and draw conclusions. These will add, in a modest but nevertheless tangible way, to the wider body of knowledge of the subject area. You will communicate the outcome of your research by writing up and submitting your dissertation. Support is available to you at every stage from the study materials, your supervisor and online forums.</dc:description>

			<mlo:prerequisite>This 30-credit course is studied over six months. Please be aware that you will need to spend at least 12 hours a week studying the course over this period. This is a postgraduate course, where we assume you have relevant academic, employment or commercial certification experience. The course provides additional Cisco-specific access material based on CCNA. However, learners who have completed Cisco networking (T216) (or the discontinued T228), or have experience of the CCNA as a commercial certification or at another Cisco academy will be at an advantage. For advice on the best order of study for T824, T828, T826 and T827, see the Postgraduate Diploma in Advanced Networking (E51). You cannot participate in the Cisco component of T827 (TSHOOT) unless you have successfully completed both ROUTE and SWITCH (or their predecessors BSCI and BCMSN) via T824 and T826 at the Open University or at any other Cisco recognised CCNP academy. Although the main study material is provided as a printed book, the supplementary material is online and so you should be confident in the use of a computer to access the Web and be prepared to spend much of your study time online. Broadband access is essential. The study material contains active content, which means that you will need to set up your firewall to allow pop-ups from the Cisco and OU sites. You do need to have a reasonable standard of spoken and written English to study successfully with us. Poor language skills will make study more difficult, and it will take longer.

			<dc:description>Why do products fail? Inadequate materials, poor manufacturing or assembly methods, bad design - failure can arise at any stage, giving designers clues as to what failed, why, and how to avoid future failures. Using real case studies, this course examines the principles of good product design and assesses the significance of poor design on the development process. You will work with techniques for analysing product failure, including scientific and engineering tests and observation. You will investigate real catastrophic failures - the Challenger space shuttle, the Hindenburg and the Tay Bridge - and consider the role of design, manufacturing, materials and communications in these fatal disasters.</dc:description>

			<dc:description>This course is for anyone interested in technology strategy in public, private sector or third-sector organisations. It's relevant to people who have to work within strategic frameworks set by their organisations as well as to those with direct responsibility for developing strategy. The course recognises the unique challenges of technology, resulting in both the planned and emergent formation of technology strategy. To capture this 'uniqueness' the course takes an overview of theoretical perspectives on strategic management, places these in a technological context, and then relates these to a range of practical techniques and approaches relevant to strategy making.</dc:description>

			<dc:description>Information systems are particularly prone to failure. Some never materialise, others appear late and/or over budget. Even those that are implemented often fail to deliver the promised levels of performance. This course aims to understand why the same problems repeatedly arise. The emphasis will be on 'learning by doing': you will be provided with a means of analysis that promotes learning from failure with a view to preventing it, in the design, implementation and operation of information systems. You will also be given the opportunity to practise your new skills in a project based upon a real-life IS failure.</dc:description>

			<dc:description>Information systems are now seldom built from scratch. They are modified from or built on top of existing ones or bolted together from third-party components. In practice, the old division between design, implementation and maintenance has largely disappeared. What has replaced it is the process of IS evolution, which this course examines. It is suitable if you are concerned with making decisions about information systems as they evolve; if you need to understand the process by which they evolve, or simply if you are interested in developing trends in organisational and technical change in the twenty-first century.</dc:description>

			<dc:description xsi:type="xcriTerms:careerOutcome">You will find the course useful if you are, or want to be, engaged in environmental decision making in industry, commerce, local government, a consultancy, a non-governmental organisation or a local community. It can benefit you in your work, community or home if you want to understand how decisions are made in complex and messy situations, and it can help you to participate effectively in environmental decision making at different levels. If you want to consider the environmental effects of a wide range of decisions, including your own, and to facilitate other people's environmental decision making, this course is for you.</dc:description>
			<dc:description>Many of our decisions and actions affect our environment, yet economic and political considerations often dominate. Defining environment to include biophysical, social, political, economic and other factors, T863 uses a systems framework to integrate 'environment' with other elements in environmental decision-making situations. You will learn techniques and skills in systems thinking including: modelling, evaluating, negotiating, formulating problems and opportunities, identifying feasible and desirable changes and taking action. The module features a case study on air travel and examples including water, energy, agriculture and climate change. You will also explore your own environmental decision-making situation through the development of a project.</dc:description>

			<dc:description>Manufacturing processes, selection of materials and design of components are three facets of the same task: making something that serves its purpose efficiently. Unlike many other manufacturing courses, this one emphasises the interaction of the three facets rather than teaching them independently. The course begins by establishing common elements of the three areas. You'll then look at the main routes to manufacture of components: cutting, casting, forming and joining. Finally, you'll examine case studies from each area. Study materials include study texts and a 'databank' of manufacturing processes - with criteria for deciding on process, material and design.</dc:description>

			<dc:description>Supply chains, coordinated on a global scale for producing and marketing goods and services, present a fascinating and important area for study. They are re-shaping contemporary business, technological and socio-economic development. They impact on everyone's lives, in both industrialised and developing countries. Supply chains are central to environmental change and to sustainable business practice. Learning how to manage them and their impacts presents fundamental organisational challenges. You will explore these complex issues through an interdisciplinary approach, using varied conceptual and analytical frameworks. The course is highly interactive, using an innovative, multimedia learning environment. An investigative project replaces a written exam.</dc:description>

			<dc:description>The core of any enterprise is the set of processes that must take place to deliver goods and services that provide value to customers and other stakeholders. To effectively design and manage business operations requires an appreciation of their strategic importance, an understanding of the human and technical factors that impact on their effectiveness, and mastery of appropriate analytical techniques. In this course, concepts and principles are taught using case studies spanning all sectors of the economy: public or private, large or small, manufacturing or service-based, and you'll have opportunities to apply your learning to your own context.</dc:description>

			<dc:description xsi:type="xcriTerms:careerOutcome">The course is for anyone who is interested in improving organisational performance; it is not confined to particular areas of commerce, industry or the public sector. Formal problem solving programmes within organisations have become increasingly common. The National Employers Skills Survey for 2005 (Learning and Skills Council, 2006) found that the lack of problem-solving skills was a particular concern for employers. Indeed, it noted that 'managers who are not fully proficient are more likely than average to lack IT skills (both general and professional), office administration skills and problem solving skills' (p.73).</dc:description>
			<dc:description>Problem solving is a necessary activity for all organisations. However, it is frequently ineffective: chronic problems that were supposedly solved re-emerge, and opportunities remain unrealised. Although many organisations have had early successes with mechanisms for problem solving and improvement, these have often foundered over time. This course provides a wide range of problem solving approaches, methods and techniques and examines their underpinning concepts, principles and theoretical backgrounds. It will enable you to investigate problems properly; and generate robust, effective solutions that are sustainable. The course also explores the nature of problems and solutions, and the management of problem solving and improvement.</dc:description>

			<dc:description>This joint technology/arts course starts with an introduction to music theory and notation and the technological techniques needed in a study of music technology. You'll study the principles of sound and acoustics and how musical terms and fundamentals relate to their physical equivalents. The course also examines the operation and characteristics of acoustic and electronic musical instruments; how music can be represented and stored; the fundamentals of recording; manipulation and transmission of sound; MIDI; current developments; and some associated legal/commercial issues. You will need a personal computer and a high-quality means of listening to music.</dc:description>

			<mlo:assessment>You will be expected to submit your tutor-marked assignments (TMAs) online through the eTMA system unless there are some difficulties which prevent you from doing so. In these circumstances, you must negotiate with your tutor to get their agreement to submit your assignment on paper. The end-of-module assessment (EMA), which is a project, must also be submitted online. Assessment is an essential part of the teaching, so you are expected to complete it all. You will be given more detailed information when you begin the course.</mlo:assessment>
			<mlo:prerequisite>This is a Level 2 course but you need no specific prior knowledge or qualification. Block 1 provides the musical concepts you will need. However, you may find it easier if you have some basic knowledge of music through playing an instrument or singing or if you just enjoy listening to music. The ability to read music is not a requirement. You should be able to carry out basic file management activities on your computer and be able to use it to execute programs, access online resources, play MIDI files, listen to music from sound files and view video clips (although you can use separate CD/DVD players for these latter two activities). Block 1 also provides an introduction to the arithmetic and technological concepts you will need; however, you will be expected to be able to carry out simple calculations using a calculator when necessary. If you have any doubt about the suitability of the course, please contact our Student Registration &amp; Enquiry Service.</mlo:prerequisite>

Critical reflection is a key component of the course, enabling you to develop an understanding of the origins and impact of individual viewpoint, your own and that of others, on policy formulation and decision-making. Also importantly for development debates is to consider how equality, social justice and inclusion might be incorporated into development practice alongside established concerns such as economic growth and environmental sustainability.</dc:description>
			<dc:description>In this interdisciplinary course you'll cover key areas of international development. These include: different models of development; shifting power in the international system; the relationship between poverty, inequality and livelihoods; the impact of conflict and insecurity; and the role of technology and the environment. The history of development as a process of change, the power relationships in that process and the different scales at which development takes place from transnational to local, are threads running throughout the course. These integrate the material - using a mix of case studies, interactive activities, text and DVD - to provide a central narrative encouraging critical appraisal and curiosity.</dc:description>

			<dc:description xsi:type="xcriTerms:careerOutcome">TD866 aims to support continual development of skills amongst managers in the public, private and voluntary sectors associated with environmental decision making. Within the UK and internationally there is substantial interest among the many existing and aspiring practitioners involved with environmental decision making for developing skills in constructing and making sense of environmentally related briefing papers and associated documentation, advocacy, argumentation, debate and evaluation.</dc:description>
			<dc:description>Have you ever wondered how to be a responsible environmental citizen? What it means to be responsible, to make a 'right' decision, or to achieve a 'just' outcome for our natural world that we share? Such questions affect many of us both on personal and professional levels. This course provides a framework for analysis, and innovative tools promoting individual and collective responsibility for decisions and action. You will examine how cultural traditions influence attitudes towards the environment, and develop skills in advocacy, argumentation, debate, evaluating direct action, and constructing and making sense of environmentally related documentation such as briefing papers and viewpoint articles.</dc:description>

			<dc:description>This course enables The Open University to recognise and give you credit for specified practice-based qualifications that you already have. If you're working in computing or ICT, you may have acquired qualifications from leading software or technology vendors like Microsoft or Cisco. Such vendors offer a portfolio of qualifications connected to a specific job function - for example Systems Administration , Systems Security , Network Engineer or Application Development - certifying that you have reached particular levels of knowledge and competence. As TM227 awards academic credit for qualifications you already have, there's no additional study involved. However, you are expected to have successfully completed a related OU course.</dc:description>

			<mlo:prerequisite>As well as specific vendor qualification(s) that you wish to claim OU credit for, you should have successfully completed the below before you register: Object-oriented programming with Java (M255) (now discontinued) and Team working in distributed environments (M253) and Putting Java to work (M257) Or Information and communication technologies: people and interactions (T209) (now discontinued) Or Communication and information technologies (T215) Or Team working in distributed environments (M253) and the discontinued courses M254 and M206 Or Team working in distributed environments (M253) and Putting Java to work (M257) and the discontinued course M206. As an accreditation of your existing practice-based qualifications, TM227 does not have any study materials or tuition associated with it. Shortly after the start of the presentation, we'll send you an assessment guide. This describes the documentation you'll need to provide when submitting evidence of your vendor qualification(s). For most vendors, this is a transcript of the exams and other assessments you have passed. However, before you register, you must check whether your own qualifications can be used to gain credit for TM227 (or its Level 1 equivalent, MT127). To see the current list of applicable vendor qualifications, visit the course website (you can also email from this page for further information).

			<dc:description>This twelve-week course is the sixth and final module of the Certificate in Web Applications Development. A web server is the key to dynamic and responsive applications, so it's essential to monitor its performance and tune its configuration. Server configuration is also critical to application security through the use of access controls and security protocols. This course explores the role of server administration and its contribution to planning, deployment, and management of a web application. It introduces tools and techniques to assist with capacity planning, monitoring of workloads, identification of performance bottlenecks, and security failures. You'll also learn about the role of routers, firewalls, and proxy servers in building network architectures.</dc:description>

			<mlo:assessment>You must use the online eTMA system to submit your computer-marked assignments (CMAs). The end-of-module assessment (EMA) is also submitted online.</mlo:assessment>
			<mlo:prerequisite>The course will appeal to a wide variety of people, for example: those who have already taken Web basics: design, development and management (TT280), The client side of application development (TT281), The server-side of application development (TT282), Databases within website design (TT380), and Open source development tools (TT381) (now discontinued) or: those who have some experience of configuration, administration, and performance tuning of a web server and a good understanding of all the web application tools and protocols covered by the other modules in the Certificate (for information see the individual course descriptions). Although you are not prevented from registering for TT382 without any previous experience, we would not recommend this as you will need to have an understanding of the technicalities of the related subject area. We therefore strongly recommend that you complete the preceding five modules (TT280, TT281, TT282, TT380, TT381) in the Certificate before starting this one. A student who fulfils the entry requirements should expect to devote 10 hours' study per week. Students with less experience will need more time. TT382 is a Level 3 course and as such places certain academic requirements on you. For example, you will need to be able to complete a 3000-word report at the end of the course and construct arguments in support of critical judgements, with minimal help or advice. If you have any doubt about the suitability of the course, please contact our Student Registration &amp; Enquiry Service. We strongly advise against studying two or more courses at the same time.</mlo:prerequisite>

			<dc:description>While you're learning about tomorrow's technology why not help build it? My digital life takes you on a journey from the origins of information technology through to the familiar computers of today, and on to tomorrow's radical technologies. You'll get hands-on experience of designing, building and programming the small, ubiquitous computers that will become increasingly common over the next decade. The profound technological, economic, political and ethical changes brought about by information technology will affect every one of us. This key introductory Level 1 course will help you prepare for that - think of it as an online survival kit for the twenty-first century.</dc:description>

			<mlo:assessment>You will be expected to submit your tutor-marked assignments (TMAs) online through the eTMA system unless there are some difficulties that prevent you from doing so. In these circumstances, you must negotiate with your tutor to get their agreement before you submit your assignment on paper. You must use the online iCMA system to submit your interactive computer-marked assignments (iCMAs). Assessment is an essential part of the teaching, so you are expected to complete it all. You will be given more detailed information when you begin the course.</mlo:assessment>
			<mlo:prerequisite>This is a key introductory Level 1 course. Level 1 courses provide core subject knowledge and study skills needed for both higher education and distance learning, to help you progress to courses at Level 2. You will need to be able to carry out all the following activities on your computer as part of studying this course: writing with a word-processor; saving and locating files; installing software; and accessing a website. You should also be able to perform simple calculations, read and understand written English of a style and complexity characteristic of a professional magazine or quality newspaper, and write clearly in English. The course will help you to develop your skills in all the following areas: using your computer, reading and writing about ICTs, carrying out calculations, and learning at a distance. If you are new or a less confident learner, start with Introducing environment (Y181) or Starting with maths (Y182). These are Openings courses, also at Level 1 but worth 15 credits. Designed with lots of support and no examination, they will give you a gentle introduction to this subject and to OU study. If you successfully complete one of these Openings courses, you'll be ready to study TU100. If you have any doubt about the suitability of the course, please contact our Student Registration &amp; Enquiry Service.</mlo:prerequisite>

			<dc:description xsi:type="xcriTerms:careerOutcome">By studying the course you will be able to examine current issues in your own working life, make sense of them using a range of innovative ideas, tools and techniques, and extend your competence as a professional. In our modern world where all organisations face increasing uncertainty and complexity, the experience of our students is that successfully completing our 'systems' courses not only benefits them personally, but is of great benefit to the organisation where they are employed. This course is ideal for those people who are in situations such as: positions where you have to work across boundaries (internal or external) those where you and others are uncertain about the nature of the problem and thus what would constitute a solution (i.e. dealing with wicked problems or 'messes') interdepartmental working parties, groups, committees managing change of some form or another having to engage others in what you are doing (i.e. building stakeholding) either within or external to your organisation or project providing leadership policy development or implementation tasks involving professionals with different perspectives on issues e.g. policy-makers and other practitioners in public sector agencies - business; government and NGOs; health services; project teams etc. inspiring innovation and/or creativity organisations where you have to work with others to get something done developing new policies that will affect a wide range of people project or programme development and/or delivery participating in or managing multi, inter or trans-disciplinary research managing a staff team working more effectively with your colleagues. This course will meet the needs of anyone engaged with taking action in situations that involve complex inter-connections, multiple stakeholder interests, and have problematic boundaries, by providing practical and conceptual foundations for managing in the broadest sense.</dc:description>
			<dc:description>This course is about managing complex situations. Managing is ultimately about taking action in complex interconnected situations, where others involved may have contrasting understandings, motivations and interests, and where conflicts inevitably arise. You will develop your understanding of complex situations using robust tools from the traditions of systems practice to think strategically about change and uncertainty. The situations that you choose to work with in the course to develop your practice with systems tools can either derive from your existing, or aspiring, professional capacity or simply be of general interest to you.</dc:description>

Rather than passively accepting change this course will equip you with skills to shape the nature and direction of change. It will develop your abilities to manage change with others so as to avoid systemic failures and improve joined-up actions amongst stakeholders along supply chains, in projects or, even, social activism. It is about learning to use systems thinking and practice to help you engage with change and act accordingly to recognise the interconnected nature of organisations and environments.</dc:description>

			<dc:description>Development management engages with the multiple challenges of 'development' - any development, anywhere - and this course sets out to build up the basic capacities for managing those challenges. It rests on the assumption that management is a political and ethical process, a matter of the use of power to bring about desired goals in contexts characterised by conflicts of interests, values and agendas. The course teaches a range of skills needed by any manager, skills to do in particular with strategic thinking, research, advocacy, planning, policy making, and evaluation. It is of relevance to managers in any sector, anywhere.</dc:description>

			<dc:description>TU871 explores contemporary debates on 'development'. It does so in interdisciplinary fashion, and with an understanding that development is not confined to a particular geographical area but is happening anywhere and everywhere, presenting us all with challenges that are professional and personal, practical and political. The first part demonstrates the need on the part of managers to appreciate the significance of context - historical, cultural, social, political, economic - if they are to bring about development. The second part confronts conventional understandings of development and encourages critical reflection on how development is best undertaken, from local through to global levels.</dc:description>

			<dc:description>Institutions are critical for the success of development processes. Managers - whether in the public sector, the private sector, or civil society - need the capacity to analyse the institutional landscape, design appropriate institutions, and establish good inter-organisational relationships. This course aims to develop those capacities by: exploring the theory of institutions and institutional development; examining the policy and practice of institutional development, in a variety of fields, including poverty reduction, governance, and humanitarian intervention; exploring how relationships built around competition, coordination and cooperation underpin institutional development; demonstrating how the skills of mapping and modelling, negotiating and brokering, contribute to institutional development.</dc:description>

			<dc:description>Development managers are often called upon to undertake investigations that contribute to changes in practice and policy. The development management project , the final, compulsory element of the MSc, provides an opportunity to learn, develop and practise the skills required for such an undertaking. The project is individually chosen, the choice determined by your own passions and priorities. The process is guided by learning from previous modules of the masters programme. And the product is a report that makes the case for change in the understanding of, and/or the practice and policy related to, a significant development management problem.</dc:description>

			<dc:description xsi:type="xcriTerms:careerOutcome">This course will be relevant if you have already been an intervener in civil war or in postwar peace support operations, or expect to be in this role in the future. You may also be linked to a humanitarian or development organisation, an international institution, a government or a military body.</dc:description>
			<dc:description>All development management interventions must deal with complexity. TU875 examines the complexity of civil wars, exploring ways in which interventions can be developed that at worst 'do no harm', at best make for a just and lasting peace. A fundamental premise is that the first step is to understand the roots of the war and the goals of the various actors. Another is the need for a vision of what is a desirable society. On this basis, the course sets out the theory and illustrates the practice of the diverse skills that contribute to the making of a good intervention.</dc:description>

			<dc:description xsi:type="xcriTerms:careerOutcome">Design thinking is an ability that can be applied to a wide range of contexts, from the personal to the business sphere. It can help you creatively engage with a problem situation in almost any discipline. Design thinking is thus a course that has vocational relevance equally in the so-called 'creative industries', and in business more generally. The course is designed as a foundation for future study in design at The Open University but will also provide a foundation in design should you be considering studying design elsewhere.</dc:description>
			<dc:description>This key introductory Level 1 course, packed with new learning innovation, will change your way of seeing and solving complex problems forever. Through a mix of academic and practical work you'll develop an understanding of design, acquire new designing skills and build a portfolio of design projects as a strong foundation for future study or work experience. This online course looks at common principles of design and ways of thinking that lead to ideas and creative solutions. Within a specially created virtual design studio you'll complete many hands-on activities and interact with your fellow students as you experience a completely different way of learning.</dc:description>

In these circumstances, you must negotiate with your tutor to get their agreement to submit your assignment on paper.</mlo:assessment>
			<learningOutcome>By studying a range of subjects, drawn from the natural sciences, technology and the social sciences, you will become more aware of the contributions each discipline makes to our understanding of environmental issues and concerns. You will also explore how people from these different fields bring together their various perspectives to help understand the many interactions between the environment, organisations and human cultures and values. This sharing of different approaches can lead to new ways of thinking about environmental problems, balancing alternative interpretations and conflicting interests, and hopefully generating new solutions.</learningOutcome>
			<mlo:prerequisite>This is a key introductory Level 1 course. Level 1 courses provide core subject knowledge and study skills needed for both higher education and distance learning, to help you progress to courses at Level 2. U116 is an interdisciplinary introduction to environmental issues that will help you to develop the necessary skills for studying at more advanced levels, such as the Level 2 course Environment (U216). It offers a great deal of help with study skills, such as taking notes, writing essays and basic scientific expressions. By the end of the course, you will be expected to be working at the level required of first year undergraduate students. We would like to encourage students from as wide a range of backgrounds as possible to study with us. If you are new or a less confident learner, start with Introducing environment (Y181). This is an Openings course, also at Level 1 but worth 15 credits. Designed with lots of support and no examination, it will give you a gentle introduction to this subject and to OU study. If you successfully complete this Openings course, you'll be ready to study U116. If you have any doubt about the suitability of the course, please contact our Student Registration &amp; Enquiry Service.</mlo:prerequisite>

			<mlo:prerequisite>This is a Level 2 course and so you should have some experience of Level 1 study, obtained either with the OU, or by doing equivalent work at another university. If you have not studied at university level before, you are strongly advised to study at Level 1 before progressing to Level 2 study. We recommend The arts past and present (AA100), Voices and texts (A150) and English for academic purposes online (L185). These Level 1 courses develop skills such as logical thinking, clear expression, essay writing and the ability to select and interpret relevant materials. Your regional or national centre can advise you on where you can see reference copies of Level 1 study materials. Some are also available from Open University Worldwide Ltd. We particularly recommend looking at these materials if you have not successfully completed Level 1 study or studied at an equivalent level elsewhere. If you have any doubt about the suitability of the course, please contact our Student Registration &amp; Enquiry Service.</mlo:prerequisite>

			<dc:description xsi:type="xcriTerms:careerOutcome">The study of environmental issues will equip you with a range of skills that are much sought after in a changing labour market and, in particular, could open up possibilities in the areas of environmental management and policy, and planning.</dc:description>
			<dc:description>Environmental concerns are broad ranging. They include global climate change; anxieties about food, polluted air, management of waste, squandering natural resources, disappearance of species and habitats; concerns over how our actions will affect future generations; and disquiet over the genetic modification of living organisms. This exciting and innovative course introduces the scientific, technological and social factors that are important in informing your approaches to these concerns. Drawing on a wide range of issues, it encourages you to understand and debate environmental changes and responses, and to consider why environmental questions are often the source of political and scientific contests and conflict.</dc:description>

			<dc:description>This interdisciplinary course examines contemporary issues such as biodiversity and climate change in order to develop your environmental literacy, and enable you to take part in informed debate and action. It draws on a wide variety of disciplines to investigate environmental changes, their consequences, and implications for action. You will explore environmental materials on the web used to publish data, implement policy, debate issues, and promulgate views - learning how to navigate, analyse and evaluate such information. Some knowledge of the environment is assumed - for example, from our course Environment (U216).</dc:description>

			<mlo:assessment>You must use the online eTMA system to submit your tutor-marked assignments (TMAs). The end-of-module assessment (EMA) takes the place of an examination. You must obtain a pass mark on both the TMAs and the EMA to pass the course. You will be given more detailed information when you begin the course.</mlo:assessment>
			<mlo:prerequisite>This is a Level 3 course. Level 3 courses build on study skills and subject knowledge acquired from studies at Levels 1 and 2. They are intended only for students who have recent experience of higher education in a related subject, preferably with The Open University. You will be expected to work more independently than for Level 2 study. You will need a knowledge of environmental issues such as you would get from Environment (U216), or other Level 2 science, technology or social science environmental courses. You must be familiar with using a personal computer, including word-processing and spreadsheet applications, and be able to work online, using email and the internet. We provide some guidance for beginners about working with spreadsheets and creating diagrams but otherwise it is assumed that you have the necessary computing skills. It is essential that you establish whether or not your background and experience give you a sound basis on which to tackle the course, since students who are appropriately prepared have the best chance of completing their studies successfully. The Science Faculty booklet Are You Ready For U316? can be viewed or printed as a PDF from the Are you ready for science? website . If you have any doubt about the suitability of the course, please contact our Student Registration &amp; Enquiry Service.</mlo:prerequisite>

			<dc:description>If you're thinking about teacher training but would find a traditional full-time course difficult, the Open University's Professional Graduate Diploma in Education (PGDE) could be the answer. The PGDE is the most popular route into a career in teaching at secondary level in Scotland. Our modular PGDE in secondary mathematics - which leads to a Teaching Qualification (TQ) conferred by the General Teaching Council for Scotland (GTCS) - offers a flexible alternative to conventional university courses. You can study on a part-time or full-time basis, taking either one or two years. You'll study the theory of teaching and learning through supported open learning, which you'll apply in practice during sustained periods of teaching in two partner schools. The study materials provide a supportive context for teacher training in today's schools across the secondary age range - introducing you to the ideas and issues that underpin effective teaching and learning. In addition, online forums enable you to take part in discussions about your subject and teaching; exchange resources for classroom teaching; and debate contemporary education issues.</dc:description>

			<dc:description>This course builds on the knowledge and skills developed in Understanding law (W200) and examines a further two Foundations of Legal Knowledge: public law and criminal law. Public law considers the relationship between citizen and state; the structure of state institutions; how government action may be challenged (judicial review); the legal values that determine a citizen's rights and duties; and an outline of civil liberties law. Criminal law considers criminal liability in the context of particular criminal offences; the requirements of specific defences; areas where criminal law is considered flawed; and proposals for reform. The course deals principally with the law of England and Wales.</dc:description>

			<mlo:prerequisite>This course will be a good choice if you have taken Understanding law (W200) and intend to obtain a qualifying law degree or if you have studied the law before, and want to develop your understanding of public and criminal law. This could be either out of general interest or because some legal knowledge would be useful in your work. The course assumes that you already have a grounding in the English legal system and up-to-date awareness (though no in detail) of the Foundations of Legal Knowledge (e.g. criminal law, law of obligations (contract and tort)). If you haven't studied for some time, we strongly advise you to take Rules, rights and justice: an introduction to the law (W100) before starting this course. If you haven't studied law before, we strongly advise you to take Understanding law (W200) first. This is a Level 2 course and so builds on your Level 1 study with The Open University or from equivalent work at another university.

			<mlo:prerequisite>This is a Level 3 course. Level 3 courses build on study skills and subject knowledge acquired from studies at Levels 1 and 2. They are intended only for students who have recent experience of higher education in a related subject, preferably with the OU.

This could be either out of general interest or because some legal knowledge of contract and tort would be useful in your work. The course assumes that you already have knowledge and understanding of the law, particularly the Foundations of Legal Knowledge, and we strongly advise you to take W100, W200 and W201 first.

			<dc:description>Is there a link between poverty and crime? Are inequality and injustice factors in anti-social behaviour? What can be done to tackle the breakdown of social cohesion that resulted in rioting and looting in Britain's inner cities? Can early childhood intervention and other crime prevention schemes provide an effective alternative to punishment through the criminal justice system? The Diploma of Higher Education in Social Policy and Criminology explores the debates that lie behind these key questions. You'll examine contemporary controversies about how to deal with the apparent rise in crime and disorder at a time of recession, rising unemployment and deepening public sector austerity; and investigate issues of crime and social policy in local, national and international contexts. This wide-ranging diploma course will equip you with concepts and theories that underpin contemporary criminology and social policy, and develop the skills you need to evaluate the range of policy alternatives.</dc:description>

			<learningOutcome>The Foundation degree in Early Years has been developed in association with employers and professional associations. It is Sector-Endorsed and considered a 'full and relevant' qualification for the purposes of registration and regulation - which means you'll count in the qualified ratio of staff at Level 3. In Northern Ireland , although the degree is not a recognised qualification for classroom assistants in Northern Ireland, it would enhance their work with Key Stage 1 children. This degree is also appropriate if you are working in a British Forces school or an early years setting in Europe following a UK or Republic of Ireland curriculum and which uses English as the language of tuition. Further development This Foundation Degree is a step to pathways leading to the graduate Early Years Professional Status (EYPS). On completing your studies, there are several options for topping up to a full BA degree - you'll need to choose your route carefully and we recommend that you discuss your choices with one of our advisers. This degree may also be helpful if you're interested in further training as an Early Years Teacher. You'll need to check with your training provider about their entry policy for ITT programmes - please note that the OU doesn't offer teacher training for this age range. For more information see our careers advisory booklet Becoming a Teacher and visit the Teaching Agency (TA) website in England; the Teach in Scotland website in Scotland; and the Teacher Training &amp; Education in Wales website . There's more information about how OU study can improve your employability in the OU's Employability Statement from our Careers Advisory Service.

			<learningOutcome>The Foundation Degree in Primary Teaching and Learning is relevant to teaching assistants, higher level teaching assistants and other kinds of classroom support staff. If you're seeking higher level teaching assistant (HLTA) status - in England and Wales only - it will prepare you to gather the necessary practice-related evidence to apply for this status. It may also be helpful if you are thinking about training to be an early years or primary teacher; your choice of optional module can also be used to support this goal. If you're considering teaching as a career, you're strongly advised to check with your training provider about their entry policy for Initial Teacher Education (ITE) programmes, as requirements vary between different universities. This foundation degree course will enable you to develop your existing practice with children and be more aware of the theories that give rise to effective teaching and learning.

			<dc:description>Starting with law explores key legal concepts such as legal capacity and the rights and responsibilities of the individual, beginning with childhood, through to adulthood and finally into old age. You will examine how the law affects us at different points in our lives, and how we gain (and sometimes lose) our legal rights and responsibilities. This Openings course gently introduces you to OU study - ideal if you're a beginner or returning to study. Also towards the end, you'll try out learning online; the perfect way to gain the basic computing skills you'll need for the next step in your studies.</dc:description>
